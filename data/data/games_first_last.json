Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.\n\nThe 1986 edition featured 4 parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players.

The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.\n\nGameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).\n  \n     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.\n\nEach mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.\n\nThe second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.\n\nAs a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.\n\nVictory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.  The person with the highest score wins.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.1649, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 6.596, "implementations": ["Elfenroads", "Elfenroads"], "designers": ["Alan R.

"description": "In Catan (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards)\u2014wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone\u2014to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.\n\nSetup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.\n\nA turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities\u2014think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.\n\nPoints are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.\n\nCatan has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.\n\nDie Siedler von Catan was originally published by Kosmos and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed Catan to better represent itself as the core and base game of the Catan series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition.

The actions are:\n- to take a variety of gems from a market stall, \n- to immediately score from between 4 and 7 points, or \n- to roll and move again and also collect points.\n\nThe action cards are revealed simultaneously. If only 1 player chose a particular action, they simply perform that action. If 2 players chose the same action, they barter back and forth with gemstones. One player will eventually accept the other's offer of gems, and the other will take the action. If 3 or 4 players all chose the same action card, that action is cancelled. Note that in 4-player games, there will always be a conflict in choice of 3 actions, so much more negotiating goes on.\n\nA new turn begins with everyone rolling their die, moving, then choosing and revealing their action cards. When any merchant piece completes a lap around the board, the round ends and bonus points are awarded based on who has the majority in each gem color and who has completed a lap.

They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyer belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. (source: http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon)\n\n\n\nIn RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.\n\nIn general, players will first fill all of their robot's \"registers\" with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!\n\nRobots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.\n\nThe game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.4329, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 7.05521, "implementations": ["Robo Rally (2016)"], "designers": ["Richard Garfield"], "categories": ["Miniatures", "Racing", "Science Fiction"], "minage": 12, "name": "RoboRally", "playingtime": 120, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": 273}, {"friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "name": "thematic", "value": 99}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": 223}], "average": 7.1646, "usersrated": 18978, "alternative_names": ["Robo Rally"], "stddev": 1.51555, "expands": [], "numcomments": 4933}, "19": {"mechanics": ["Tile Placement", "Voting"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic786075.jpg", "wishing": 122, "owned": 2351, "expansions": [], "trading": 169, "artists": ["Chris McGloughlin", "Franz Vohwinkel"], "id": 19, "yearpublished": 1991, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 150, "wanting": 51, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic786075_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Hans im Gl\u00fcck Verlags-GmbH", "Mayfair Games"], "families": [], "description": "A long time ago, in a village far, far away, some disturbed townsfolk decided to destroy their entire town in order to rid themselves of an evil menace (it's technically a dog-mouse, but I think it's an idiomatic thing).  Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads.  To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses.  When an outhouse would be destroyed, players take a vote on whether to place that particular section.  Each player is trying to retain the most of one type of building, and once all the pieces have been placed the winner is the person with the highest valued buildings still standing.\n\nWacky, Wacky West re-make description:\n\nFans of Klaus Teuber will be interested in this remake/redesign of Drunter und Dr\u00fcber, a 1991 Spiel des Jahres winner.\n\n\nJust south of nowhere, there's the junction of the Mayfair & Rossdorf RR and the Turvy Trunk Line. Springing up from the desert like a tumbleweed lies the eccentric little town of Rossdorf. Like most western towns, Rossdorf has a Land Agent: Guy Dough, the brother of that wicked varmint Black Benny. A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mind-marbling drink the locals call \"Wacky Water!\" \n\n\nNow that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment #5, which states: \"no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens...\" Now one thing's for sure: something's gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon.....\n\n\nIn Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings. Every time someone tries to build over a precious outhouse, the town votes! You try to enlist your supporters (represented by cards) to vote with you to stop or encourage the play of certain tiles-perhaps saving some of your buildings or taking out those of your dastardly opponents.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.8467, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 5.99027, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Klaus Teuber"], "categories": ["American West", "Bluffing", "City Building"], "minage": 9, "name": "Wacky Wacky West", "playingtime": 45, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": 1977}, {"friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "name": "familygames", "value": 567}], "average": 6.31269, "usersrated": 1437, "alternative_names": ["Drunter & Dr\u00fcber", "Sans dessus dessous"], "stddev": 1.20342, "expands": [], "numcomments": 464}, "20": {"mechanics": ["Action Point Allowance System"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic451783.jpg", "wishing": 324, "owned": 782, "expansions": [{"id": 6467, "name": "Full Metal Planete: Plateau Modulaire"}], "trading": 24, "artists": ["Pascal Trigaux"], "id": 20, "yearpublished": 1988, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 54, "wanting": 181, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic451783_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Ludod\u00e9lire"], "families": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!"], "description": "In this game of science fiction strip mining, players land on a planet and try and grab as much ore as possible and take off before the game is over.

The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.\nTo this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.\n\nAs a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.\n\nMAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.\nThe complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.\n\nBetween exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises. You will find this like no other board game you have ever played.\n\nAvalon Hill Complexity rating - 9\n\nSee also the list of articles about Magic Realm in The General.\n\n", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 4.494, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 6.51617, "implementations": ["Magic Realm Light 30"], "designers": ["Richard Hamblen"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Exploration", "Fantasy"], "minage": 12, "name": "Magic Realm", "playingtime": 240, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": 799}, {"friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "name": "thematic", "value": 153}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": 471}], "average": 7.1359, "usersrated": 1680, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 1.95891, "expands": [], "numcomments": 969}, "23": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Variable Phase Order"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1440309.jpg", "wishing": 200, "owned": 908, "expansions": [], "trading": 43, "artists": ["Kenneth Rahman", "David C.

Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.\n\nStarting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris & Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This \"ziggurat expansion\", initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.\n\nSome versions of Tigris & Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players.

The game consists of a single deck of cards of rank 2\u201310 in 5 different colors with 3 special \"handshakes\" (\"HS\" in scoring examples below) in each suit. There is also a board which functions only to hold and organize discarded cards and is largely superfluous. Games last around 15 minutes. This is generally considered a good \"couples\" game and is often recommended for people with non-gamer partners.\n\nThe object the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the 5 colors. On a player's turn they must always first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the appropriate discard pile, and then draw one card. There is a separate discard pile for each color and a player may draw the top card of any discard pile or the top card of the deck. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.\n\nThe game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the draw pile. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total. Expeditions start at a value of -20 so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least 8 cards played into it. The player with the most points wins the game, but it is typical to play 3 matches and add your score from each to see who wins.\n\nScoring example 1: an expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 minus the initial -20.\n\nScoring example 2: an expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, minus the initial 20, \u00d73 for the 2 multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.\n\nScoring example 3: an expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 minus initial 20, \u00d72 for the multiplier.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.5188, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 7.05616, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Reiner Knizia"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Exploration"], "minage": 10, "name": "Lost Cities", "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": 272}, {"friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "name": "familygames", "value": 39}], "average": 7.14071, "usersrated": 25832, "alternative_names": ["Les Cit\u00e9s Perdues", "Le Citt\u00e0 Perdute", "Elveszett V\u00e1rosok", "Exploradores", "Izgubljena Mesta", "Kadonneet Kaupungit", "Zaginione Miasta", "Ztracen\u00e1 m\u011bsta", "\u03a7\u03b1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b5\u03c2", "\u03a7\u03b1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b5\u03c2", "\u0417\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u044f\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430", "\u5931\u843d\u7684\u57ce\u5e02", "\ub85c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ud2f0 (\uc783\uc5b4\ubc84\ub9b0 \ub3c4\uc2dc)"], "stddev": 1.2721, "expands": [], "numcomments": 6992}, "51": {"mechanics": ["Grid Movement", "Modular Board"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1766273.jpg", "wishing": 875, "owned": 6089, "expansions": [], "trading": 95, "artists": ["Franz Vohwinkel"], "id": 51, "yearpublished": 1999, "maxplayers": 15, "numweights": 451, "wanting": 202, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1766273_t.jpg", "publishers": ["ABACUSSPIELE", "Devir", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Hans im Gl\u00fcck Verlags-GmbH", "Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.", "Oya", "Playgo Hungary", "Rio Grande Games", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.", "Z-Man Games"], "families": ["Robots", "Solitaire Games"], "description": "Ricochet Robots is less of a game and more of a puzzle, which explains why there's such an odd number of solutions possible.

The game comes with a gorgeous map drawn in the style of the period. Movement is conducted via a point-to-point system following the roads and towns in the area around Quebec. The game comes with handfuls of blocks to represent the British and French units.\n\nThis title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets, all of their games are based on the block system. Basically this means that rather than using the traditional counters to represent units on the map the game uses wooden blocks that stand upright with unit details only shown on one side. This does two things:  First it provides an easy way of producing a \"fog of war\" because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is or its current strength. Second, having the blocks stand on end allows the possibility of rotating a block so the current strength is the top number. Although most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength, counters normally have at most two steps because they only have two sides. Blocks, however, have four so you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide.

Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points.

The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.

After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.\n\nIn each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).\n\nA turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.\n\nThe goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region.

It is a light tactical war game during the age of sail where two ships face off against one another on the sea.  There are basically two layers to the game, the broadsides portion in which players plot their movement with a deck of cards, attempting to maneuver their ships in such a way that they can fire a volley of cannon balls at the opponent while minimizing the risk of return fire.\n\nThe second layer of the game begins when the movement of ships results in them bumping into one another.  In these instances the Boarding Parties portion comes into play.  Here players line up their ships next to one another and attempt to storm the other ship and kill the opposing captain.  Players can only move a limited amount of their units each turn and so some planning is required to hem in the opposing captain.\n\nThe components for the game are quite elaborate.  Each player is given a fully detailed plastic ship about a foot long with removable masts.  Also, each player is given a whole crew of little plastic pirate figures, cannon, and captain.

The game has a beautiful assortment of large, thick tiles to represent the cities. Players bid on a single building tile every turn, with half the proceeds going to the auctioning player. When a player is ready to start construction of his city, the tiles are laid out in order with the single restriction that not two touching tiles are the same type. The building types are city halls, churches, towers, and gates. When the one of the two draw piles is exhausted, the cities are judged for symmetry, with the highest scoring city winning.\n\nRules apply to either game:\n\nWithin two decks of 20 cards are contained the City Wall, Towers and Gates, Churches, City Halls, etc. During play, one of the decks lies face up, the other face down. There are three parts to each player's turn. First, the player rolls a die in an attempt to better his finances (1 to 5 on the die; the sixth side gives a sabotage-counter instead). Second, he alone may look at the top hidden card before he makes an offer on either of the two top cards from the two decks. The other players then bid on the two cards. If the player (the Auctioneer) makes the highest bid, he may take the card and pay the bank. If, on the other hand, one of the other players buys the card, that player pays half the money to the bank and half to the Auctioneer. Third, a player may either build (lay down another card on his city) or sabotage a City Card of another player. The player receiving the sabotage must then pay the value of the card or remove it.\n\nThe game ends when either of the decks is depleted.\n\n", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 2.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 5.67245, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Jean du Po\u00ebl"], "categories": ["City Building"], "minage": 10, "name": "Wettstreit der Baumeister", "playingtime": 45, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": 4163}], "average": 6.11419, "usersrated": 355, "alternative_names": ["Les Grands Batisseurs", "Teutopolis", "Teutopolis de Luxe"], "stddev": 1.21774, "expands": [], "numcomments": 124}, "110": {"mechanics": ["Auction/Bidding", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic348799.jpg", "wishing": 254, "owned": 1823, "expansions": [], "trading": 79, "artists": ["Jochen Frick", "Harald Lieske"], "id": 110, "yearpublished": 1987, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 127, "wanting": 127, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic348799_t.jpg", "publishers": ["F.X.

Take It Easy is a true multi-player solitaire in which each player individually completes a hexagon-shaped board with spots for 19 hexagon tiles. There's no limit to number of players if you've got enough sets on hand. One person (the caller) draws a tile randomly and tells the others which of the 27 tiles featuring colored/numbered lines crossing in three directions, with numbers from 1 to 9, it is. \"The 9-8-7,\" for example. Each player then chooses which empty spot on his own board he'll play the 9-8-7. This is repeated until the boards are filled.\n\nThe idea is to complete same-numbered lines across your board. Scoring is calculated by multiplying the number on the tile with the number of tiles in the completed line. A complete column of three 9s is worth 27, for example...but a lot of players will hope for five 9s to fill the big column down the middle.\n\nTake It Easy is often compared to Bingo because of the familiar pattern of a number being called and then everybody looking at their cards to play it, and then scoring if a line is completed.

The first edition in 1903 had a deck of 63 cards, 9 each of 7 commodities, each with a value (ranging from 40 for Flax to 100 for Wheat). Players offer trades by crying out the number of cards they want to swap (\u201cOne! One! One!\u201d, or \u201cThree! Three! Three!\u201d) but not their identity. The winner of the hand is the first to collect all of one commodity, declaring \u201cCorner on Wheat!\u201d or whatever commodity has been collected. The winner of the hand scores points equal to the value of the commodity, and the winner of the game is the first to 500 points.\n\nThe 1904 Edition of Pit added much fancier artwork and the famous Bull and Bear cards, which provide wild-card and penalty features. The early editions allowed a maximum of 7 players, but later versions supported 8 and in at least one case up to 10.\n\nPit\u2019s designer, noted psychic Edgar Cayce, is often accused of having stolen the idea from the game Gavitt\u2019s Stock Exchange (G-S-E) invented by Harry Gavitt. While G-S-E claimed patents dating as early as 1896, it involved trading railway shares, and was only copyrighted and published in 1903, the same year as Pit. Also hitting the market in 1903 was Bourse, a remarkably similar open-outcry commodity trading game from Flinch Card Co., using an 80-card deck with 10 each of 8 commodities.  Pit, however, seems to have cornered the market on open-outcry games, as neither of its competitors were seen again after 1904.\n\nPrintings:\n\n    Parker Brothers (1903-???)\n    Out of the Box Publishing (2004-Present)\n    Winning Moves Games (USA)\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMicrobadges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 1.1648, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 6.26024, "implementations": ["Go Bananas!", "Jurassic Jumble", "POT: The Card Game", "Wheedle"], "designers": ["Edgar Cayce", "Harry Gavitt", "George S.

Each gets 2 special action cards.Each round: First, players may play a single special action card, in order. Then, Trade Step. Finally, Action Step.\n\nTrade Step: Start player first plays cards (2-3) to offer, one at a time; other players simultaneously show cards to trade, different than offered. Start player must trade; recipient either accepts cards into hand, or leaves out. Clockwise from Start Player, next player with cards still in front of them either makes a trade or takes their cards back. Continue till 0-1 people left with cards in front; they take them back to hand.\n\nAction Step: Start player takes 3 actions, then others take 2 each. Actions can be:\n- discard 2 cards, then draw 2\n- turn in set of 3-7 cards to send half (rounding down) as many cubes from earth to a planet\n- turn in set of 3-7 cards to advance Ship Level, Tech Level, or to make attempt to establish colony on a planet matching cards played: place cubes on that planet into the cosmic ashtray, randomize, then reveal up to as many cubes as attempts made. If reveal your cube, place it on a station; turn over. If other player's cube, send it back to earth.\n- Sets: if no wilds (\"pure\"), take appropriate bonus wild card matching the size of the set (if available); wilds can be used later as parts of sets\n\nThen rotate starting player to the left. Game ends when all stations on 3 planets have been taken. Score VP shown on board (for Tech level, stations occupied, and cubes on earth). Most VP wins.\n\n", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 2.2283, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 6.01425, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Alan R.

The goal of the game is to generate a set amount of money once you've linked all the major cities.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.766, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 6.4438, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Darwin Bromley", "Steven Courtemanche", "Larry Roznai"], "categories": ["Economic", "Trains", "Transportation"], "minage": 10, "name": "Eurorails", "playingtime": 240, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": 901}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": 513}], "average": 7.05836, "usersrated": 1540, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 1.43048, "expands": [], "numcomments": 524}, "158": {"mechanics": ["Auction/Bidding", "Hand Management", "Point to Point Movement"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic9688.jpg", "wishing": 158, "owned": 1344, "expansions": [], "trading": 41, "artists": ["Doris Matth\u00e4us"], "id": 158, "yearpublished": 1999, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 51, "wanting": 101, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic9688_t.jpg", "publishers": ["999 Games", "AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH"], "families": ["Elfen Travel", "Fairies, Elves and Pixies"], "description": "This is an expansion for Elfenland, not to be confused with the stand-alone game of the same title (Elfengold) published by Alan Moon's now-defunct White Wind game company.

Players bid against one another to purchase the transportation tiles that are available each turn. To generate the gold for these purchases, players must make a choice each turn to either take gold or more cards. This can be a very difficult decision as tiles are useless without cards, and vice versa.\n\nAs is becoming normal, this expansion was released shortly after Elfenland won Spiel des Jahres.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.6275, "expansion": true, "bayesaverage": 6.10741, "implementations": ["Elfenroads"], "designers": ["Alan R.
