The fishermen who nets the most valuable haul wins the game.\n\nSet-up in Kraby differs depending on the number of players, with 80 or 120 tiles in play, the game board being 9x9 or 11x11, and the number of colored crab figures being 10, 12 or 15. Each player starts by secretly drawing six crab tiles (which come in four colors with two players and five colors otherwise) and placing them behind their screen. On a turn, a player chooses one tile and enters it from any side of the game board, sliding it in the row or column until it hits the island at the center of the board or another tile in play. (A move that would slide a tile off the board or create an impossible-to-fill space is illegal.) The player then draws a new tile and places it behind his screen.\n\nA player then has the option of placing one of the colored crab figures in his ship's hold. Each ship has three holds, with a scoring multiplier of x1, x2 or x3. A player can claim a color only once and cannot place it on the same multipler as another player. In a four-player game, a player can claim only two figures.)\n\nThe game ends once the final tile has been placed and the game board filled. Each group of crabs in the same color, with orthogonally adjacent crabs belonging to the same group, is worth -1 to 5 points depending on its size. Once the value of a color is determined, each player scoring this color multiplies this value \u2013 which might be negative \u2013 by the multipliers showing on his ship's hold.

On a turn, a player moves one or more of his figures based on the roll of the die, splitting up the movement points as desired; alternatively, a player can select an officer or general before rolling, thereby allowing him to move that figure (and no others) twice or three times the number rolled.\n\nIf a player\u2019s figure lands adjacent to an opponent\u2019s, the players each roll a die to see which figure is sent to the sidelines, with officers receiving a +2 battle bonus and generals receiving +3. By reaching promotion zones on the board, you can upgrade figures by one rank, making them more powerful in battle.\n\nPermanent and temporary safety zones provide some cover as you move figures around the board. Your goal is to break through the wall surrounding the opponent\u2019s compound, whether by assulting the wall directly or using special demolition spaces, then occupy his bunker, scoring points for doing so.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Curtis Paul"], "categories": ["Dice", "Fighting", "Miniatures"], "minage": 8, "name": "Xtreme Takeover", "playingtime": 25, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}, {"friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "name": "wargames", "value": null}, {"friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "name": "abstracts", "value": null}], "average": 4.85714, "usersrated": 7, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 2.21544, "expands": [], "numcomments": 8}, "49480": {"mechanics": ["Modular Board", "Set Collection", "Variable Player Powers"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic522642.jpg", "wishing": 5, "owned": 4, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": ["Peter Cobcroft"], "id": 49480, "yearpublished": 2009, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic522642_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Web published)"], "families": [], "description": "2-6 players spend 5 rounds building or impeding each other's dungeons.

This game allows players not only to explore what conditions contributed to this outcome, but also whether the Mexicans might have been able to achieve victory.\n\nPlayed on an authentic 19th-century map of Mexico, Mexican War includes both introductory and standard rules. Based on the rules system of the popular introductory game We The People, it is ideal for introducing youngsters and new players to the hobby, yet substantial enough to attract the veteran gamer. Complexity is low for the Basic Rules to moderate for the Standard Rules (about 2/10 to 3.5/10 respectively).\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Rob McCarter"], "categories": ["American West", "Wargame"], "minage": 12, "name": "Mexican War", "playingtime": 150, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}, {"friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "name": "wargames", "value": null}], "average": 0.0, "usersrated": 0, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 1}, "41773": {"mechanics": ["Storytelling"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic463695.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": ["Kathryn Medeiros"], "id": 41773, "yearpublished": 1990, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic463695_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Personal Growth Company"], "families": [], "description": "\"The game that lets you look back on those touching, surprising, inspiring, and hilarious moments in your life.\"\n\nThis family storytelling game includes a spinner, 4 Grab Bag lists, 108 instruction cards, rules, \"gold\" metallic coins, and storage insert.\n\nPlayers spin to determine the turn order and then draw a card and follow the instructions -- for example: Tell about a time your mother embarrassed you.

Their objective, a bridge along the main axis of advance. But first the men of No. 11 Commando will have to silence a menacing battery of Vichy howitzers.\n\nBC3: 42ND STREET CRETE, May 27, 1941: German mountain troops stream over the rocky hillsides pursuing what they think is a beaten enemy. But as they approach a major Allied supply dump, they bump into a fighting patrol from the Australian 2/7th Battalion. The Aussies launch a bayonet charge which could be their last of the war.\n\nBC4: TIN CANS TIN HATS, SYRIA, July 8, 1941: A Vichy tank sitting on a bridge is holding up the Allied advance. The Australians send a company of infantry to evict the unwanted vehicle but the R35 has friends and won\u2019t go quietly.\n BC5: STORMING THE AMPHITHEATRE, BOUGAINVILLE, February 6, 1945: The whistle of shells and the dull thud of smoke rounds alert the Japanese defenders on their fortified ridge line. Before long the Australians emerge from the shroud and into a wall of withering fire.\n\nBC6: WALKABOUT, BOUGAINVILLE, March 30, 1945: A rumble of tank tracks and the sight of the lurching armoured monsters sends panic through the Japanese ranks sitting in their muddy foxholes, but their leaders steady their charges and order them to fire at the supporting infantry now coming into view.\n BC7: BRIGADE HILL, NEW GUINEA, September 8, 1942: The Australians defending along the Kokoda Track face an unprecedented disaster. Somehow the Japanese have enveloped an entire brigade and cut the line of communication to headquarters.

The pitching team then chooses one of the three categories, the hitter's card is revealed, and the higher total in the selected category wins.  Each team gets to play 9 hitters, and the team with the most hitters' victories wins the game.\n\nIn 2011, additional rules were added to form the \"Major League\" rules, and the original ruleset was dubbed the \"Home Run Derby\"; cards were designed with additional information for the new rules. Under the Major League rules, the game takes place on a \"baseball field\" poster provided in the starter set. One pitcher pitches for an entire inning, but may not throw the same pitch twice in a row. Hits are no longer automatically home runs, but the batter moves a number of bases as indicated on his card. Players have offensive and defensive abilities that allow them to change the effects of hits, pitches, runs, and outs. Ball fields and mascots were added to the card set, and can affect the game.\n\nFrom the starter box back:\n\nIntroducing Topps Attax, the new card game that puts you in charge of the action!

Kings of the Sea was developed with three major goals in mind:\n\nThe first of these goals was to bring House Greyjoy back into the LCG environment. From this perspective, the expansion consists of a Greyjoy deck that is similar to the out-of-the-box decks that you\u2019ll find in the AGoT Core set. With a mixture of both new cards and old school Greyjoy reprints (some modified and updated for the LCG environment), House Greyjoy can once again stand proudly alongside (or, if you prefer, against) Houses Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, and Targaryen in the LCG environment.\n\nSecondly, I insisted on using the design of the Kings of the Sea expansion as an opportunity to address some of the context and synergy concerns noted earlier. In this product, you\u2019ll find numerous King and Queen characters, some new Kingdom locations, and a spattering of Military Battle, Intrigue Gambit, and Power Struggle plot cards. Additional use for crested characters is also prevalent (particularly Holy and War), and a major black hole in the AGoT LCG metagame, a realistic check on powerful locations, has been confronted.\n\nThird (and not unrelated to the context and synergy discussion), we wanted this expansion to have something for everyone, even if they\u2019re not at all interested in House Greyjoy. Thus, each House gets at least 1 King or Queen, and the plot deck (with the exception of an important House Greyjoy only plot reprint) along with many of the neutral cards were selected as cards that could potentially be useful building blocks in the widest possible array of decks. So even a die-hard Lannister player (there aren\u2019t really any of those out there, are there?) should be able to find something of use in this set.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 3.0, "expansion": true, "bayesaverage": 5.99933, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Nate French", "Eric M.

Using a shared deck of 55 Operations Cards, each player makes decisions concerning the deployment, combat and political-military operations in support of his forces and his general strategy.

Greenberg (co-creator of Wizardry), Rick Dutton, Walter Freitag, and Michael Massimilla.[2] In this first title, players leave their homeworlds setting out to explore the vast unknowns of space. Per the official game text:\n\nIn 2815 A.D., the majority of the human race is afraid of space. They are cloistered in the Nine Worlds (Earth and eight colonized planets) in a region called the Galactic Fringe. Even though space travel has been practical since the invention of the dual-axis hyperdrive in 2257, humankind's attempt to colonize \"Beyond the Boundary\" came to an abrupt halt in 2490. The \"Space Plague,\" a gargantuan epidemic caused by an organism of alien origin, killed more than half the humanoid population of the galaxy, threatened the extinction of civilization, and forever changed mankind's attitude towards space.\n\nNow, a Space Patrol enforces the \"Boundary,\" that one-way border around the Nine Worlds in order to prevent anything like the \"Space Plague\" from ever happening again. Now, anyone may leave the area enclosed by the Boundary, but they may not return.\n\nThus far, the Boundary has proven effective in keeping ships from entering the Nine Worlds for three centuries, keeping humanity safe from the unknown. Of course, this does provide for a bit of stagnation, as well. After all, no new discoveries, no new challenges, and countless lost opportunities hardly seem compatible with a growing standard of living. Finally, there are those who sense that something is amiss... \"\n\nThe game is unique in the fact that it is a boardgame in which the computer acts as a moderator and tracks resources.\n\n Reimplemented by: \n\n\n     Star Saga: Two \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The Clathran Menace\n\n\n", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 2.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": ["Star Saga: Two \u2013 The Clathran Menace"], "designers": ["Rick Dutton", "Walter Freitag", "Andrew C.

In this title, a gigantic armada of alien ships scours the galaxy, seeking to eliminate any and all sentient life. Players must quickly explore the accessible reaches of space, hoping to uncover technology with which to oppose this threat. The game background text describes this as:\n\nThe ominous approach of the survey line of Clathran battle and colony ships was sweeping through the galaxy, identifying, classifying, and exterminating all in its path. Known collectively as the \"Clathran Menace\", it meant many things to many people. To most of the human race, it meant nothing, as they were being purposely kept in the dark by their \"superiors\", so as not to cause any undue panic. What good was it to evacuate a city in the face of impending disaster if the only road out of town wasn't finished?\n\nTo Professor Lee Dambroke, Dean of the Department of Xenobiology on the university world of Harvard, the \"Clathran Menace\" was a matter of science and knowledge; the line must be breached and stopped, or the darkness of ignorance and stagnation would fall over the galaxy for all eternity.\n\nTo Laran Darkwatch, mystic Disciple of the Final Church of Man, it was a question of faith; faith in the ultimate triumph of good over evil, faith in the Founders of the Final Church, and faith in their vision of mankind's place in the Cosmos.\n\nTo M.J. Turner, the top pilot in the Space Patrol, or the whole galaxy for that matter, it was a question of pride; pride in the abilities of mankind to overcome all obstacles in pursuit of its ultimate destiny ... to rule the stars.\n\nAll were impressive goals, solid tenets upon which to build a society and a glittering future. Or were they merely brittle conceits, ready to crumble at the first pressure from the \"Clathran Menace\"?\n\nAlthough Star Saga was to be released as a trilogy, Masterplay went out of business before the third game was released, leaving only Star Saga: One - Beyond the Boundary and Star Saga: Two - The Clathran Menace.\n\nThe game is unique in the fact that it is a boardgame in which the computer acts as a moderator and tracks resources.\n\n Sequel to: \n\n\n     Star Saga: One \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Beyond The Boundary\n\n\n", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 2.2, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": ["Star Saga: One \u2013 Beyond The Boundary"], "designers": ["Rick Dutton", "Walter Freitag", "Andrew C.

If either die displays a 6, both dice and one counter are passed to the player on the thrower's left.\n\nA player without counters cannot roll the dice, and thus merely passes them on.  (He or she is not out of the game, however, since  he or she will receive a counter if the player on the right rolls a 6.)\n\nPlay continues until there is only 1 counter left outside the pot.  The player with this counter makes three consecutive rolls.  If he or she does NOT roll a 6, then he or she has won.  If, though, a 6 is rolled, the counter and the dice are passed to the player on the left, who in turns rolls three times.  And so on. The first player to roll three times without a 6 wins the game.\n\nDespite being entirely luck-based, the game is fun on account of its dramatic twists and turns and come-from-behind wins.

Perhaps inevitably, tensions rose between them. Each entered the imperialist race very late and had to content itself with the leftovers which the British and French had passed by. When the United States seized Spain\u2019s colonial empire in 1898, German jealousy raged hotly. Some German business leaders lusted for the Philippines and Puerto Rico, urging the Kaiser to purchase them from the Spanish before the war ended, or from the Americans afterwards.\n\nGerman and American squadrons did not, as legend has it, almost come to blows in Manila Bay during the Spanish-American War \u2014 the British spread that story, eager to cultivate American public opinion. But the German and American admirals on the scene did cultivate an intense dislike for one another, and the feelings spread to the top on both sides.\n\nBlack Waters is a 64-page book supplement for the Great War at Sea series based on American plans to fight Germany. Most of the scenarios take place in the Caribbean Sea, but some actions are also placed in European waters.\n\nThere are 210 die-cut and mounted playing pieces, the same pieces that originally appeared in our now out-of-print U.S. Navy Plan Black.  The Americans get ships ranging from three examples of the South Dakota class through the first American dreadnoughts, the South Carolina class, and the last of the American pre-dreadnoughts, the Connecticut class. There are also a pair of light carriers based on American plans to convert big armored cruisers.\n\nThe Germans add three of the GK4531 battle cruiser design and three representatives of the GK4251 battleship. And of course Germany receives an aircraft carrier, the proposed conversion of the huge liner Imperator. Argentina and Brazil receive part of their fleets, and there are two hypothetical Mexican battleships and small contingents from the Netherlands, Venezuela and Colombia.\n\nThere are over two dozen new scenarios, including the \"War Plan Silver\" subset based on Woodrow Wilson's very serious threat to go to war with Italy in May 1919, plus revised versions of most of those originally seen in Plan Black.\n\nThis is not a stand-alone game; ownership of U.S. Navy Plan Gold is required to play most of the scenarios and Mediterranean, Jutland and U.S. Navy Plan Red to play all of them.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "expansion": true, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": ["Great War at Sea: U.S. Navy Plan Black"], "designers": ["Michael Bennighof"], "categories": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Nautical", "Wargame", "World War I"], "minage": 0, "name": "Great War at Sea: Black Waters", "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}, {"friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "name": "wargames", "value": null}], "average": 7.45833, "usersrated": 12, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 2.19335, "expands": [{"id": 4914, "name": "Great War at Sea: 1898, The Spanish American War"}, {"id": 20889, "name": "Great War at Sea: Jutland"}, {"id": 4769, "name": "Great War at Sea: The Mediterranean"}, {"id": 22758, "name": "Great War at Sea: U.S. Navy Plan Gold"}], "numcomments": 10}, "41990": {"mechanics": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic464346.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 4, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 41990, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic464346_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Ado"], "families": [], "description": "Excitement and fun in the jungle for very young and old.\n\nWho finds a path through the jungle first?

This builds a piece of that trilithon, and scores your team a point.  You may overpay in order to get extra points.\nAlternatively, if you move a druid from one quadrant to the next, you draw two cards, keeping one in your hand, and putting the other face-up in front of you.\n\nIf you build on a trilithon, you automatically use any appropriate cards your team has face-up on the table.

Additionally, each player has a secret color to which they can play invalid votes, which will be removed before tabulation of the college.  This also means that those votes are not awarded to the winner of that college.  Finally, each player has a secret \"fetish stone\" in the inner ring.  If you win the college containing your fetish stone, you win two bonus votes.  The player with the plurality in final votes wins - respecting the same unforgiving rule for ties as is used for the colleges!\n\nThe High Druid is an official game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game.\n\n", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 3.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Bruno Faidutti"], "categories": ["Political"], "minage": 0, "name": "The High Druid", "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 5.99975, "usersrated": 4, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.707107, "expands": [], "numcomments": 4}, "41998": {"mechanics": ["Trick-taking"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic180581.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 6, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 41998, "yearpublished": 2007, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 1, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic180581_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Titanic Games"], "families": ["Country: England", "Stonehenge Games"], "description": "Magic of Stonehenge is a bluffing game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game.

The game is played with long dice which are the traditional dice in India.\n\nThis game begins with Rama and Lakshmana leaving Ayodhya and follows their adventures in the forest. The game takes you through the stay at Chitrakoot, Bharata\u2019s encounter with Rama, the meeting with Shoorpanaka and the incident of the golden deer.\n\nThe idea of the game is to introduce the characters of the epic to children in a fun package which is easily absorbed and retained. It is suitable for children over five with some adult guidance.

Player two then does the same thing in the opposite corner using a different color pen or pencil (Fig a).\n\nFig a\n\nGame play\n1. At the start of each turn, a player has the option of (1) moving to an open adjacent dot (a dot is considered to be \u201copen\u201d if it has not already been circled by an opponent), or (2) turning one of the four squares one quarter turn, either clockwise or counterclockwise.\n2. If a player chooses to moves his token to an adjacent dot, the player then circles that dot, and draws a line segment of his/her color between the two dots. Tokens may only be moved vertically or horizontally, never diagonally.\nIf a line segment created by a player\u2019s move creates a closed box, the player places his initial in that box to claim it. If a box is unclaimed at the start of the next player\u2019s turn, that player may initial it, thereby stealing it.\nPlayers may choose to hop between adjacent cards, but lines are never drawn between dots of adjacent cards.

A line segment of any color represents a blocked path\n\n3. If a player chooses to rotate a card, the player does so and the player\u2019s turn ends. A card may never be rotated in one direction by one player and then back in the opposite direction by his opponent on the following turn.\n\n4. The game ends when both players agree that it is impossible for either player to create any additional legal line segments. If only one player is unable to move or create a legal line segment, his/her opponent is allowed to continue if he/she can move/rotate squares in such a way that additional line segments can be made. When no more line segments can be created, players tally their points to determine a winner.\n\n5. The game is also brought to an end if one player either moves or hops onto another player\u2019s token, thereby capturing his opponent.

No figures are removed, so it is not critical how figures are based.  Suggested basing is 2 figures for infantry skirmishers and cavalry, and 4 figures (in two ranks) for non-skirmish infantry.  The typical units are 3 stands of cavalry (regiment) or a mixture of pike and shot stands for infantry (1 pike and 2 shot for a Swedish/Dutch regiment and up to 36 figures for a Tercio).  The scale is 1 figure = 50 men and 1\" = 50 yards.\n\nSignificant features of the rules:\n\n- Each command group of units is given a standing order which it must follow.  Units continue to follow these orders until a new order is sent from the overall commander.  If the overall commander is too far away from the command, there will be delays in adopting the new order.\n\n- No figures are removed when damage occurs--units simply receive Disorder Markers (DM).  When ordinary units have accumulated 2 or more DM's (Tercios 4 or more DM), the unit becomes \"unformed\" and is unable to move at full speed and is less effective in fighting (e.g., unformed pikes are no longer at an advantage vs. cavalry).  Units automatically rally off disorder markers at a rate given by their morale and other attributes, and additional DM's can be rallied off if the unit remains stationary or has an attached commander.\n\n- Melees are resolved in multi-round battles until one side routs or is eliminated.  Losers of a round will accumulate Disorder Markers and be pushed back.  At some point, one side or other will rout and begin to retreat off the board.\n\n- Once a player loses a certain percentage of its units (depending on the army), units begin to retreat towards their board edge.\n\nNo army lists are included, but scenarios are included which may give examples of typical units.  Scenarios included are: Seminara (French vs. Spanish, 1495), Barletta (French vs. Spanish, 1502), Otumba (Spanish vs. Aztecs, 1520), Pavia (French vs. Imperial, 1525), Breitenfeld (Sweden vs. Catholic League, 1631), and Rocroi (French vs. Spanish, 1643).\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Manny J.

These forces were in the perfect position to raid German freighters and air transports heading south to supply Rommel and the Afrika Korps in North Africa.

Colbert is a board game designer and puzzle and game manufacturer. An advertising executive, he came up with the idea of marketing a real estate trading game called Hometown Monopoly in which the properties on the board that are purchased and rented would be actual businesses in the hometown of the person purchasing the game. He produced his first game in 1980 for the city of Oshkosh, Wisconsin. He and a good friend, Arnold Miller of La Crescent, Minnesota held the copyrights and trademarks for the Hometown Monopoly series of boardgames through their holding company, Milco, Inc. Colbert incorporated Citigames of America, Inc. in 1982, and with that company and Hometown Productions, both Milco licensees,  went on to produce localized monopoly games for over 500 cities and towns in the United States and Canada. In 1985, Colbert developed Hometown Trivia and began to market that series of board games through Colbert Productions and Butler Games, Ltd. In 1986, Colbert marketed Puzzlement, a localized jigsaw puzzle that was sold only in Oshkosh and is a rare find today.\n   In 1988, Colbert sold the Trademark rights to the name Hometown Monopoly to Parker Brothers, Inc., producer of the famous MONOPOLY board game, licensing back from them the right to continue to produce his games in the cities and towns where he had developed versions of that game. In 1996, Colbert produced his last Hometown Monopoly game, fittingly an updated version of his original Oshkosh Monopoly.\n   Also in 1996, Colbert shifted his publishing focus from board games to magazines, building a second successful business with The Apartment Directory and The Builders Guide, both magazines serving the Fox Valley region of Wisconsin.\n   Colbert's Hometown Monopoly games for Baltimore and Washington DC led to his involvement with the nation-wide unification event, Hands Across America, which earned him an invitation to President Ronald Reagan's Second Inaugural Ball.\n    Today, David A. Colbert is retired and lives in West Palm Beach,\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["David A.

The rules are even able to incorporate the some of the more problematic aspects of modern operations such as air support, artillery barrages, fortifications, smoke screens, engineering operations and so forth into the same fast-play, narrative based system.\n\nDespite being deceptively simple in appearance, the Combat Cards provide a very challenging game full of hard choices and long range planning. The fact that every card can offer multiple options, that there is no way of knowing exactly when certain cards will appear in a player's hand, and that not every unit will be available at all times (e.g. due to combat effects, confusion, etc.) forces players to carefully weigh the benefits and risks of almost every tactical decision within the framework of their overall strategic plan.\n\nIn addition, with the incorporation of expansion decks, even more challenge and detail can be easily added to the base game. This allows players to customize the rules to the level of complexity they most enjoy.\n\nAnd if folks prefer their battles more in the form of a traditional board game, the Combat Cards can be combined with the new Tactical Assault: Legendary Battles\u2122 print-n-play packs. These sets give Combat Card players everything they need to play exciting battles in a hex and counter style format - including unique scenarios, beautiful full color maps and more than enough counters to allow players to develop their own scenarios.

The game is also played by Dungans, who have brought the game with them to Central Asian countries such as Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.\n\nRules\n\nThe game is played on a 7x8 grid, with pieces played on the points, much as in Go. Players take turns alternately placing stones until the board has been filled up, attempting to form 2x2 squares with their pieces. When the board has been filled up, players each remove one of their opponent's stones. The player then counts up the squares that he/she has formed and removes an equal number of the opponent's pieces, as long as those pieces are not part of a square. After the initial removal of pieces, players take turns moving pieces; pieces can move any distance along the grid up, down, left, or right. Every time a square is formed, the player can remove one of the opponent's pieces(again, as long as this piece is not part of a square). The player who removes all of the opponent's pieces first is the winner. Thus, the game is similar in concept to Nine Men's Morris.\n\nPlaying equipment\n\nThe game can be played on any 7x8 board using black or white go stones, even on the intersections of a chessboard. The game is popular in agricultural communities in northwestern China, and often played on a board traced out on the ground.\n\nVariants\n\nThe Xinjiang variant of square chess is played on a 7x7 board. Because this leads to an odd number of playing points (49) the first player has an advantage. Thus, the second player is allowed to remove one more piece from his/her opponent during the initial removal of pieces.\n\nOther variants of the game allow encirclement of pieces, as in Go. Still other variants disallow certain moves, for example, forming a square in the same way repeatedly (similar to the ko rule in Go).\n\nBecause of the game's popularity among country folk in rural areas, there are a great many variants of the game, each local to a specific area.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "minage": 8, "name": "F\u0101ngq\u00ed", "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}, {"friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "name": "abstracts", "value": null}], "average": 7.0, "usersrated": 2, "alternative_names": ["Di\u016bf\u0101ng", "Square chess", "Xi\u00e0f\u0101ng"], "stddev": 1.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 1}, "42226": {"mechanics": ["Set Collection", "Trick-taking"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic474291.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 2, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 42226, "yearpublished": 1975, "maxplayers": 7, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic474291_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Originals Only"], "families": [], "description": "\"Card games with Yiddish\".\n\nThis game comes with a double deck of standard cards with several extras: In the lower left, a letter A-Z; upper right, a number 1-52; and in the center, a Yiddish word or phrase, with its English translation.

The first player to do so is granted 5 points and the first to reach 50 wins the match, which can be achieved in two, three or four rounds of games.\nt was first brought to England prior to 1895 by Sir William Henry Wilkinson (1858-1930), a British Sinologist who served as British consul in China and Korea and who wrote many articles and books on Chinese games such as A Manual of Chinese Chess (1893), Chinese Origin Of Playing Cards (1895), The Game of Khanhoo (1895) and Bridge Maxims (1918).\nIn 1891 Wilkinson induced the card maker Charles Goodall to issue a special pack of cards with accompanying booklet of rules to play Khanhoo. The deck contained two sets each of Ace through Nine of Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds, with two specially-designed Jacks, Queens and Kings standing in for the \"extra cards\".\n\nThis entry is for the game promoted by Wilkinson and should be distinguished from the earlier Kanhu or Kwa Oh played with money-suited playing cards.

English version distributed by BANDAI AMERICA. The game is anime stylized but is not based on an anime (until later versions) it was created by Michael Elliot, game designer for MTG, and also creator of Duel Masters.\n\nThere are six different categories of cards. Each represented by a different Gem stone. Ruby, Diamond, Amethyst, Sapphire, Topaz, and Emerald. Each gem set possesses specific powers, abilities, and types of spirits which are unique to each gem set.\n\nThe game is based around a \"core\" concept. Each player begins with 5 life which is represented by gems included with the game; also players begin with 4 \"core\" in their reserve that are also represented by the same gems used to indicate your life total. The goal of the game is to reduce your opponents life to zero, or through \"crushing\" your opponents deck so they can no longer draw any cards.\n\nAs players receive damage from their opponents actions their life transfers from your life area to your reserve where you can pay for spirits, spells, and nexus's essentially adding a balance to the game; so that even though you may be on the receiving end of an assault you are gaining the ability to respond with a counter attack. Your reserve refreshes at the beginning of every turn with each core you had spent on the previous turn and you gain 1 additional core every turn.\n\nThe game at its base is very simplistic, but as you play in more advanced degrees it tends to have a \"poker\" feel to it, as you can bluff and certain plays give away \"tells\" and whatnot, it takes about 45 minutes to play a match (best 2 of 3 games)\n\nAlthough the game requires basic strategy, there is a lot of involvement in the deck building process, because your resources are on a differing track from your deck there is no mulligan, such as in MTG, however you only begin with 4 core in reserve so you want to include spirits and cards in your deck that work with your \"core\" production curve. This concept makes a large portion of the spirits and spells in the game to be very attractive to deck building which makes individual cards very cost effective.\n\nBattle Spirits is currently on it's 4th edition with the 5th set releasing Sept. 10th. It is relatively unknown because it is only distributed to local hobby retailers and online hobby stores. It is currently unknown when the game will hit the mass market, but is expected to gain high popularity with the younger crowd as the anime will be hitting US airways hopefully in the spring of 2011.\n\nBANDAI AMERICA will send you a free demo deck (all constructed with cards from the first set) they are white backed which indicates they are not approved for sanctioned tournament play, however they are adequate for casual gaming and can give you a good taste of the game mechanics.\n\nFor more information please see Bandaicg.com/battlespirits regarding how to play, how to obtain your free demo deck, you can also watch videos on YouTube by searching for \"Bandai CG\".\n\nOn behalf of the Battle Spirits community, I warmly welcome you to the game! \n-Brandon Anderson (Top 8 X-championship GenCon 2010)\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.5, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Mike Elliott"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Collectible Components"], "minage": 10, "name": "Battle Spirits: Trading Card Game", "playingtime": 45, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}, {"friendlyname": "Customizable Rank", "name": "cgs", "value": null}], "average": 7.185, "usersrated": 20, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 2.42039, "expands": [], "numcomments": 12}, "42258": {"mechanics": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic471363.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 6, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 42258, "yearpublished": 2009, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic471363_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Elastic Earth"], "families": [], "description": "Endango is an environmental board game that teaches kids how to go green.

Rivals around the Baltic Sea seize the opportunity to get their hands on Swedish territory. An alliance is struck between Denmark, Saxony-Poland, and Russia, the last under the vibrant leadership of Tsar Pyotr. This coalition mobilizes to take advantage of the untried King, and break Swedish dominance in the Baltics forever... Thus opened the Great Northern War, ravaging Northern and Eastern Europe for over two decades at the beginning of the eighteenth century. By the end of the war, one nation would lose its status as a Great Power, while another would rise to dominate the region for centuries onward.\n\nPAX BALTICA is a two-player wargame covering the entire Great Northern War (1700-1721). Published first as a limited \u201cguerilla\u201d edition in 2009 by Three Crowns Game Productions of Sweden, this new enhanced edition has been revised and upgraded by GMT Games in conjunction with the original designers.\n\nOver twenty years of fighting span the map from Norway to Turkey, Saxony to Finland. Units are represented by labeled wooden blocks, which are stood upright to conceal their identity and strength from the enemy, allowing players to dupe and outfox each other on campaign. Action points are spent to maneuver on the map, but also for reconnaissance, replacements, or a roll on the treacherous but lucrative National Politics Table. Straightforward rules account for lines of communication and forage, as well as time-consuming sieges, adding to the period flavor. The fast-paced and exciting combat system captures the aggressive \"charge with cold steel\" tactics that Sweden used to defeat her enemies in succession at the start of the war.\n\nPlayers are subject to a host of influences and distractions that will hinder their plans at every turn. An elaborate plan will be at the mercy of a poor action roll or sudden plague, while other events shape strategy with historical motivations and deterrents. Players must prepare for the worst, but be open to fleeting opportunities.\n\nSpecial rules capture simply the unique events and circumstances of the Great Northern War, including:\n\u2022 Russian army reforms\n\u2022 Ukrainian Cossack uprisings\n\u2022 Intervention by the Ottoman Empire\n\u2022 Polish royal politics\n\u2022 Attrition of Swedish manpower\n\u2022 Founding of Sankt-Peterburg\n\nFour scenarios are included with the game: a short tournament scenario covering the Swedish invasion of Russia that led to the Battle of Polt\u00e1va; two scenarios that simulate the first and last half of the war; and a \u201cgrand campaign\u201d scenario that refights the entirety of the Great Northern War, a first in wargame publishing. Turns typically take no more than a couple of minutes, ensuring a fast pace of play. Swings of fortune ensure that no two games will turn out the same.\n\nCan you save Sweden\u2019s empire? Or ensure Russia\u2019s rise to prominence? You make the choices that will determine who reigns over the PAX BALTICA.\n\nComponents:\n\u2022 1 Map (22\u201d x 34\u201d)\n\u2022 1 Rulebook (16 pages)\n\u2022 1 Playbook (32 pages)\n\u2022 65 wooden blocks (units) in five colors\n\u2022 1 sticker sheet for mounting on blocks\n\u2022 51 wooden cubes (control markers, etc.) in six colors\n\u2022 8 dice, 4 blue and 4 green\n\nGame Design: Stefan Ekstr\u00f6m and G\u00f6ran Bj\u00f6rkman\nDevelopment for GMT: Scott Muldoon\nComplexity: 4\nSolitaire Suitability: 3\nScale: Strategic. 1 turn = one season; units are armies, regiments, and fleets; 1 strength step = approx. 1500 troops or 6-8 fighting ships\nPlayers: 2\nTime to Play: 1-2 hours for the shortest scenario, 7-14 hours for the grand campaign\n\n\nOriginal Three Crowns edition:\n\nGreat Northern war, a 21-year long war lasted from 1700 to 1721 and ended Sweden\u2019s period as a major power in northern Europe and started Russia\u2019s domination of Eastern Europe. An intriguing conflict that is often considered a side-show of the War of Spanish succession. Nevertheless the former had probably greater impact of the developments in Europe during the 100 years to come than the latter. The effects of the war are in fact still seen today.\n\nPax Baltica. Probably the first board game ever covering the entire Great Northern War.  The game includes five different scenarios with a varying playtime between two hours and a day. The units in the game are blocks which give a great flexibility in taking steps and differentiate the quality and strength of the troops. The high quality map is divided into provinces which you have to conquer in order to take control over a country. This dynamic conflict covers large parts of northern and eastern Europe. From Bremen in the West to Smolensk in the East. From Trondheim in the North to Bender in the South.\nPlayable nations are Sweden, Russia, Turkey, Denmark and Saxony.

You will also get score sheets and team reference sheets.\n\nDICE Hockey also features a full career mode.  Lace them up as a skater or a goalie and start working on becoming a legend on the ice.  You start out as a border line player and as you accomplish certain tasks in a game you can earn points.  Spend those points on card upgrades.  The better you perform the more points you earn.  You will get over 100 blank player cards in your game and more will be available for free whenever you need them.\n\nDICE Hockey is available as both a print and play E-game or you can purchase the actual hard copy board game version.

It will stretch your mind as you look for circles among the triangles.\n\nCircle Out! game is one of the great modern classics. It calls upon parts of your brain that rarely get much exposure. For this reason, little children can often gain an advantage over adults who are just beginning to learn the game. Playing the game is an excellent visual memory exercise. Circle Out is filled with strategy \u2013 and winning is never a simple matter of chance.\n\nInstructions:\n\nTo play the game shuffle the deck and lay out 12 - 16 cards on the table. All players must race to find the most circles of the largest size.\n\nPlayers should not touch the cards until a circle has been found. When you find one, say \"Circle!\" and then you may take the cards that form your circle.\n\nOne predetermined player will lay out additional cards to replace the ones that have been taken. Continue to play until all of the cards are gone. Two decks may be combined to lengthen the game.\n\nWhat? Circles? All I can see are triangles! Think of each card as a link that belongs to a chain. A circle happens when the ends of your chain come (link) together.\n\nJust remember that same colors link together and that triangles on the top may only link to triangles on the bottom and vice versa. For example, a blue triangle at the bottom right corner of a card will link to any blue triangle at the top left corner of another card.\n\nScoring:\n\nCircles of three are worth 1 point, circles of four are worth 2 points, circles of five are worth 3 points, circles of six are worth 4 points and circles of seven cards are worth 5 points.\n\nOr just subtract 2 from the total number of cards in your circle and that is how many points it is worth. For example, a five-card circle is worth 3 points (5 - 2 = 3).\n\nThere can be up to seven cards per circle only because there are only seven colors. Each color may only be represented once in each circle by one top triangle and one bottom triangle.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Joseph Lytle"], "categories": ["Card Game"], "minage": 8, "name": "Circle Out!", "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 4.38889, "usersrated": 9, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.737028, "expands": [], "numcomments": 5}, "42404": {"mechanics": ["Simulation"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic474337.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 42404, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 24, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic474337_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Sports Games International"], "families": ["Cities: Chicago (Illinois, USA)", "Country: USA", "Sports Teams: Chicago Cubs", "Sports: Baseball"], "description": "Contents:\n70 Pitch cards each with six baseball questions and answers based on Chicago Cubs history\nBaseball diamond game mat\nInstructions for play\n\nTwo teams of players vie to answer the most trivia questions, each question being worth a single, double, triple or home run.

It is upon the Heroes to explore the dungeons, fight back waves of Monsters and assault Monster encampments.\n\nDungeon Crawl features a vast, flexible game system with many different play modes.  Play through the 35 Adventure Campaign with the Dungeon Lord, who fields and plays as the Monsters during the Campaign.  Pit your Heroes against your friends' own characters in the Deathblow Arena.  Play solo or with friends in randomly generated dungeons that don't require a game master, and fight mighty and cruel bosses that will test the Heroes like no other Monster has.\n\nCombat, the bread and butter of any dungeon crawler, is quick and simple, requiring only two rolls (attack and defense) to figure out if the player has hit, and how much damage he caused.  Gameplay is streamlined for quick play, so you don't have to sit around for hours on end on a single scenario.  Each player can take their turn in just seconds, so you don't have to constantly wait for minutes for someone to make up their minds.\n\nPlayers advance in levels to learn Skills, chosen from a list based on the Hero's Race and Class.  Try different Race and Class combinations for interesting skill sets!  Heroes can join Guilds to earn benefits, and must face trials to advance in Guild rank.\n\nDungeons are built from 20 available dungeon tiles, each complete with rooms and corridors.  In the dungeons the players will search for treasures in all sorts of different furniture, and fight over 50 different monsters.  Roll on charts or use the included cards to search for treasure or lay out the dungeons.\n\nCustomize your games with a slew of optional rules.  Don't like the Heroes walking around with 50,000 gold in their pockets?  Bring in the Load rules.  Decided that traveling five weeks to another city shouldn't be a cakewalk?  Invoke the Travel rules to add some peril to their journey.\n\nThink your gaming group might not be up to more advanced modes of play?

For the points to be valid, the player needs to get to the space where there is pictured a little paw, next to the space where there is food. He takes the piece from the game board and starts on the way back. If the player safely succeeds to return to the hole, he keeps the piece and can leave for the next one. Depending on where the food piece was on the board, it can have various amounts of points (the amount of points is given on each piece next to the picture with the food). Three pieces (with the navy blue background) have the greatest punctual value (6 points), but when carrying it, the player moves one space less then what was rolled on the die. The collected points are added together. The game ends after a player gets the amount of points that was determined upon earlier, or after there are no more food pieces on the game board (the total amounts to 72 points).\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["Animals", "Children's Game", "Dice", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "minage": 6, "name": "Tom and Jerry", "playingtime": 25, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}, {"friendlyname": "Children's Game Rank", "name": "childrensgames", "value": null}], "average": 5.0, "usersrated": 2, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 4.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 2}, "42470": {"mechanics": ["Co-operative Play"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic476784.jpg", "wishing": 11, "owned": 92, "expansions": [], "trading": 11, "artists": ["Jo\u00e3o Menezes"], "id": 42470, "yearpublished": 2009, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 5, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic476784_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Majora"], "families": ["Country: Portugal"], "description": "Aljubarrota is a cooperative game for 3 to 6 players, but it can be played solo as well.\n\nThe game elements try to reproduce faithfully the events of the battle of Aljubarrota at the same time trying to teach some of the curious battle facts that made Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira one of the finest military Portuguese strategists.\n\nTo be published on the last trimester of 2009 by Majora.\n\n", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 2.4, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 5.53334, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Gil d'Orey"], "categories": ["Educational", "Medieval"], "minage": 7, "name": "Aljubarrota", "playingtime": 70, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": 8653}, {"friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "name": "wargames", "value": 2120}], "average": 6.30417, "usersrated": 48, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 1.77634, "expands": [], "numcomments": 13}, "42471": {"mechanics": [], "median": 0.0, "image": null, "wishing": 1, "owned": 11, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 42471, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 2, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": null, "publishers": ["Lambourne Games", "Owzat Games"], "families": ["Sports: Boxing", "Sports: Combat Sports / Martial Arts"], "description": "From the Publishers website:\n\nChampionship Boxing is intended to be a realistic simulation of top-class boxing producing accurate results and incorporating all the relevant factors such as boxing skill, punching power, stamina etc. Considerable thought has been given to a system of play that captures some of the 'feel' of boxing, while still playing quickly. Once the play mechanics have been thoroughly grasped each round takes only on to two minutes to play and each bout can be set up and the Scorecard prepared in about five minutes. It is thus feasible to fight a whole series of bouts in an evening's play, quickly building up statistics and rankings for all weight divisions.\n\nThe ratings will, of course be contentious. Everyone has their own opinion about the qualities of their own favourite fighter. All I can say is that each rating has been carefully researched, contemporary fight reports have been studied where possible, different opinions have been carefully weighed and several sources have been examined in arriving at the final figures. If you disagree with any rating try to clear your mind of bias and prejudice an if you still disagree, change it! As the purchaser the game is presented entirely for your pleasure, don't let my opinions spoil it for you!\n\nOn the subject of alteration of ratings the game does have another function beyond the mere replay angle. It can be used to answer some otherwise unanswerable questions. Not just, 'Who was the best, Marciano or Ali? But questions like, 'How good could Henry Cooper have been if he had not been so vulnerable to cutting around the eyes?. Would Sugar Ray Leonard have been the world's greatest ever welterweight if he had had the hitting power of Thomas Hearns? Would Floyd Paterson have been a great champion if he had had a sounder chin? The answers are there for you to  explore, just change those rating!

A standard 52 card pack, without joker, is used. The cards rank in the usual order: A (highest) K Q J T 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 (lowest).\n\nDeal and play are clockwise. Each player receives 3 cards. The rest of the cards are laid face down in a pile on the table (stock).\n\nObject of the game\nSkitgubbe has two phases. In the first phase players collect cards for the second phase. In the second phase the object is to get rid of one's cards as fast as possible. The last player left with cards in hand is the loser and becomes the skitgubbe.\n\nPlay in the first phase\nThe first phase consists of tricks of 2 cards. The player to dealer's left leads first. Any card can be led and the player to the left of the leader plays any card to complete the trick. At this stage the suits have no significance and there is no requirement to follow suit. Each player draws a card from the stock immediately after playing, so that each player always has a hand of three cards so long as there are still cards in the stock. Whoever played the higher card wins the trick, places the two cards face down in front of himself, and leads to the next trick. If the player who led wins the trick, he leads again and the same two players are involved in the next trick.\n\nIf the two cards played to a trick are equal it is called a stunsa (bounce); the cards are left on the table, the two players each draw a card from the stock and the same player leads again. This continues until one of the players wins the trick and takes all the cards played, including the cards from the tied tricks.\n\nIn this first phase, the second player to a trick is under no obligation to try to beat the card led. If a low card is led the second player may wish to play lower and give the trick to the leader, for it is important to collect strong cards in the first phase of the game, so gain an advantage in the second phase.\n\nThroughout the first phase, when it is your turn to play and there is still more than one card in the stock, instead of playing from your hand you may turn up the top card of the stock. If you turn a card from the stock you must play it - you may not put it in your hand.\n\nThe last card from the stock determines the trump suit for the second phase. The player who has to draw this card takes it but does not add it to his hand but keeps it face down until the first phase is over.\n\nWhen the stock is exhausted, the play continues as long as possible with the cards players have in their hands. If some players have cards left in hand at the end of the first phase they keep them for the second phase. If the final trick of the first phase is a bounce, the players take back the cards they played to it and keep them for the second phase.\n\nPlay in the second phase\nThe players have now divided the 52 cards between themselves, but the cards are probably not divided equally; some players have more cards than others. The player who drew the trump card leads. The object is to get rid of one's cards as fast as possible.\n\nNow you must either beat the previous card played or pick it up. A card may be beaten by a higher card of the same suit, and a non-trump may be beaten by any trump. It is never lawful to duck. If you cannot or do not wish to beat the card in front of you, you must take it up into your hand, and it is then the next player's turn to lead to a new trick. If there is more than one card lying on the table and you cannot beat the last card played, it is only this last card which you must take up into your hand. It is then the next player's turn to beat the card which was underneath it.\n\nA trick is complete when either:\n\nthe number of cards in it is equal to the number of players who were in the game when the trick began, or \nall its cards have been picked up. \nIn the first case, the cards in the trick are set aside and the player who played last (and therefore highest) to the trick leads to the next. In the second case, the player to the left of the player who picked up the last card leads to a new trick. \nSuppose there are 3 players; player A has led and player B beaten A's card. If C now beats B's card, C puts aside the cards and leads to the next trick; but if C does not beat B's card but picks it up, it is now A's turn to beat the card showing on the table (which is in fact A's own lead). If A does this, and then B beats A's card, it is B who has completed the trick; B sets aside the three cards and leads to the next trick. Another possibility is: A leads, B beats A's card, C picks up B's card, and A picks up his own card. It is now B's lead.\n\nNote that as players run out of cards, the number of cards in each trick reduces. If there are three players, one of whom runs out of cards during a trick, that trick still requires three cards to be completed (or all its cards to be picked up), but the next trick will require only two cards.\n\nFor example suppose there are 3 players: A, B, C. A leads his last card, B beats it, C picks B's card up, B beats A's card again, and now C beats B's card. The trick is now over, and C leads to the next trick. As there are now only two players, the new trick will have only two cards. Another example with three players: A leads; B beats with his last card, C picks this card up, and A picks up the card he led. It is now B's lead and the next trick will be complete with two cards.\n\nA player who gets rid of all his cards can draw a sigh of relief, for he is not the loser. The loser is the player who is left with the last card in his hand, and is called \"Skitgubbe\" (or \"Mas\" or \"Mattis\"). Skitgubbe means \"dirty old man\" (in the sense of unwashed, rather than obscence); Mas and Mattis mean fool.\"\n\n- Description and rules credited to John McLeod from his excellent website here:\n\nhttp://www.pagat.com/beating/mattis.html\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.3333, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["Card Game"], "minage": 7, "name": "Skitgubbe", "playingtime": 15, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 5.46154, "usersrated": 13, "alternative_names": ["Mas", "Mattis", "Mj\u00f6lnarmatte"], "stddev": 1.90608, "expands": [], "numcomments": 5}, "42478": {"mechanics": ["Voting"], "median": 0.0, "image": null, "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 42478, "yearpublished": 1997, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": null, "publishers": ["(Unknown)"], "families": ["Country: Egypt"], "description": "A board game where player's try to answer questions to be the first on top of the pyramid.

In LCBG you play 3 rounds, scoring at the end of all 3 for the monuments you collect. (Normal scoring occurs each round.) In Keltis, you only play 1 round, and score everything each round. This is not just a rule difference, as the scoring is different for the monuments/stones based on the number collected.\n\n2. In Keltis, you may play your cards in either order, descending, high to low, or ascending, low to high. In LCBG, you must play in ascending order.\n\nNote: the rules for LCBG have the Keltis rules as variants, and have the board elements necessary for #1 above. Keltis does not have the rules nor board elements to play LCBG.\n\n\n     Kosmos (Keltis publisher) changed the card play to ascending and descending order to lower the luck level and add balance to the game.\n     Kosmos changed the theme to fit in with other Kosmos abstract game series. \n\n\nThere are more differences, which are non-substantive. Lost Cities: The Board Game has a different-looking board, tiles and figures (meeples) to connect with its predecessor. Card-play in descending order is an optional variant in this edition. The numbers have been multiplied by 5 to strengthen the relation to the card game, and instead of a scoring track you collect your points as golden coins.\n\n\nFrom the Keltis entry:\n\nPlayers play cards to move their playing pieces along stone paths. There are cards with 5 different colors/symbols, each corresponding to one path; in addition, each card shows a number (0-10, twice each). In each color, each player can play his cards either ascending or descending. Like Lost Cities, it's better to concentrate on a few paths, since the last spaces grants high points, but ending early gives negative ones.\n\nThe player in turn plays one card (out of a hand of 8), or discards one. He moves the corresponding playing piece on the path. Many of the spaces have a token that grants some bonus - either direct points (counted on the scoring track), an extra move on a path, or wish stones that are needed at game end to avoid negative points.\n\nThe game ends when a total of 5 playing pieces have reached the 7th space (or more) on their paths. Now, scoring happens:\n\n\n     Pieces which only moved 1-3 steps give negative points (-4, -3, -2).\n     Pieces with 4+ steps grant points (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10).\n     One piece of each player is higher and scores double.\n     Fewer than two wish stones grants negative points (-3 / -4)\n     5+ wish stones yield a bonus of 10 points.\n     All this is added to the points scored during the game\n\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.7485, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 6.50031, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Reiner Knizia"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Exploration"], "minage": 8, "name": "Lost Cities: The Board Game", "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": 823}, {"friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "name": "familygames", "value": 169}], "average": 6.834, "usersrated": 2649, "alternative_names": ["\u0417\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u044f\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 2"], "stddev": 1.29061, "expands": [], "numcomments": 660}, "42488": {"mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Memory"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1152085.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 42488, "yearpublished": 2008, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1152085_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Xalingo Brinquedos"], "families": [], "description": "De onde as coisas v\u00eam?\nDescubra a origem de muitas coisas interessantes jogando com seus amigos.

When starting a new lap player may declare \"taking special cargo\" - which gives bonus money after full lap, but can be easly lost, when doubles are rolled. During the game player may buy the roads he/she passes. When the route is complete (player bought all roads of the one color - for example: H1, H2 and H3) each road separately may be upgraded (3rd class road, 2nd class road, 1st class road superclasshighway). Player collects money fees for passing his/hers roads from another player. Unlike in Monopoly Tranzyt's board is elliptic. There are also shortcuts, and special areas (AutoService, Bridge, Tunnel, Ferry, Parking, Fuel Station).

They immediately set about to \u201crestore the promise of America\u201d through wide sweeping reforms. The rich were taxed. The poor received free health care, education, and housing. Big Business was regulated. The environment was saved. The civil rights of pornographers, illegal immigrants and underage children were preserved. The victory of Labor over their capitalist exploiters was assured for the first time since FDR.\n\nBut these reforms provoked equally widespread opposition from right-wing extremists. It became obvious that after the next election the minions of rich Wall Street capitalists would overturn many of the reforms and renew their attacks on the environment. The Christian Right stood ready to poison the minds of school children with creationist dogma. Only quick action by right-thinking patriots could save the Republic\u2026\n\nPlay the crusading Big Government do-gooders or their gun-toting Conservative opposition. Each turn players can choose from various political actions as they attempt to \u201csave the Republic\u201d in their own way. Eventually martial law will be declared and the game takes on more of a military nature, as bullets instead of ballots determine the destiny of America. The game features overseas garrisons, militia recruitment, terrorist attacks, packing the Supreme Court, the National Guard, defecting government troops, air strikes, UN intervention, mass arrests and more as each side tries to \u201crestore the promise of America.\u201d\n\nThe rules are written from a darkly humorous perspective and the game is fun to play, a real conversation starter.

There are three kinds of pieces: scissors, paper and rock. The capture-rules for White are as follows: white scissors take black paper, white paper take black rock and white rock take black scissors. Correspondingly the capture-rules for Black: black scissors take white paper, black paper take white rock and black rock take white scissors.\n\nIn the beginning of the game each player has four pieces of each kind, i.e. 12 pieces in all. The board is divided into 6 by 6 squares and the pieces are set according to figure 1. The game is over, when other player wins the game or the players agree on a draw. The player wins the game, when he/she captures the other player's last piece or when the other player cannot move any piece.\n\nThe moves\nEach player, in turns, moves one piece. The White player starts the game. Every piece can be moved in the same way: one square at a time in any direction on the board, i.e. forwards, backwards, to the sides and also diagonally forwards and backwards. If a piece does not capture another piece within a move, it can be moved only to an empty square.\n\nIn the game is one special move, called return-move: When a piece has made it to the opponent's side to the last row, it can be moved back on some of the next turns, to its own side's first row, to the same column's or adjacent column's empty square. (There is at most three possible squares for a return-move.) When making a return-move, the piece can be exchanged for a piece that is not currently on the board. Making the return-move the piece can not capture other pieces. Examples of possible moves and return-moves are presented in figure 2.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 3.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["J.

The campaign was a brief, bloody, and confusing affair fought between two armies which were considered equals by many in the world.\n\nDespite the interesting campaign, there aren\u2019t many war games on the Polish campaign, probably because the conventional wisdom is that it was a very unbalanced contest. This is informed mostly by hindsight. The German Army knew it had superior numbers and organization, but much of its equipment was no better than that fielded by the Poles, the concept of blitzkrieg had not been proven in actual combat, and they were not at all sure that the campaign would not bog down into static fighting. As it was the Germans lost over 16,000 dead in five weeks of campaigning.\n\nSummer Lightning uses a proven game system that features an interactive sequence of play and near-diceless combat that both shows the historical German superiority in command and control and is flexible enough to allow players to explore many variations and options, so that the game can be as equal (or unequal) a contest as they want. Options include: variable Polish deployments; greater or lesser surprise and speed of mobilization; changed attitudes of the Soviet Union or neighbouring countries; French intervention; Plan Zachod (the Romanian Bridgehead Strategy); and even the possibility that the Blitzkrieg, so appealing in theory, fizzles out on the battlefield. Also, because so many war games are designed for two but played by one, an optional solitaire play method is included.\n\n", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 2.8571, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 5.5572, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Brian Train"], "categories": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "minage": 12, "name": "Summer Lightning: The Invasion of Poland 1939", "playingtime": 240, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": 7304}, {"friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "name": "wargames", "value": 1456}], "average": 6.905, "usersrated": 40, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 1.3461, "expands": [], "numcomments": 18}, "42592": {"mechanics": ["Card Drafting"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic479074.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 5, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 42592, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 8, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic479074_t.jpg", "publishers": ["F.X.

One player will control the Axis forces (Vichy French, French colonial troops, and Germans), while his opponent controls the Allied forces (British, Commonwealth, Free French, etc). The playing pieces represent the actual units that participated in the campaign and the map represents the terrain over which those units fought. The players maneuver their units across the map and conduct combat according to the rules of play. One player wins by capturing certain specified objectives while his opponent wins by avoiding those victory conditions.\n\nWhen Free French leader Gen. de Gaulle visited the Middle East in April 1941 he forced a political crisis by demanding the occupation of Syria. As a result London ordered an offensive to place all of Syria and Lebanon under Free French control. Sadly, such posturing caused Allied command staffs to hold unrealistic views of what the ensuing occupation would look like. Certain authorities believed the Vichy French in Syria would offer only token resistance and their defense would collapse like an eggshell. The thinking held that Vichy forces could be won over with wine and coffee along with displays of the Australian slouch hat. Instead, the Vichy-led troops fought ferociously from the start.\n\nPlayers should feel free to combine play of this game with that of Rommel's War, published by L2 Design Group. Both games include the same historical moment, have identical scales, and have some of the same historical units.

Not a good thing. Operation Sherdil (Lion Heart) began in August 2008 and was initially aimed at preventing the imminent fall of Khar, headquarters of Bajaur District, to the Taliban. The military operation was intended to reclaim all of Bajaur from the Taliban and al Qaeda, which amounted to around 3000 terrorists. On August 3rd, a 200-strong force from the paramilitary Frontier Corps were surrounded by 300-400 Taliban fighters, heavy fighting erupted as they tried to break out. After a three-day battle, the Pakistani troops routed back to Khar, and the Taliban seemed victorious. They quickly followed the Pakistani force and began to threaten Khar. Operation Sherdil was later expanded to recapturing all of Bajaur district from the Taliban. This proved to be a tall order and led to a protracted series of battles over two months. Pakistan's resolve came into question (as it still does). By late October, many of the objectives had been reached but not all. Loysam was not retaken until Oct. 25th. Over 2700 terrorists had been killed, yet, Bajaur Agency remained unsettled when the army left. It remains so to this day.\n\nThe Game\nEach turn is six days, with half mile hexes. Units are battalion and company for Pakistani forces, and platoon size for al-\nQaeda and Taliban. The game is a true conventional military force taking on the terrorist groups in Bajaur Agency from August through October, 2008. The terrorists were well armed and had fortified many of the small towns outside of the city of Khar. They had been slowly taking over the area. Sherdil was prompted when a small force of paramilitary found themselves surrounded and under siege at Loysam from 300 Taliban. This Pakistani force managed to breakout and fled to Khar, which was under Taliban pressure. It was at this time the Pakistani military unleashed its forces in what many claim ended in a draw. Some 8000 soldiers, 20 Cobra gunships and F16 jets pounded the enemy, which numbered 3000. Pakistan's resolve came into question with this early offensive.\nIn the game, the Pakistani army does not have unlimited resources to conduct a long offensive as each attack will cost. How well the Pakistani player orchestrates his attack will dictate who the winner is. The Taliban can literally appear and disappear in certain types of terrain making any attack questionable. Their unique movement and evasion will cause any Pakistani player frustration.\n\n", "minplayers": 0, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Perry Moore"], "categories": ["Modern Warfare", "Print & Play", "Wargame"], "minage": 0, "name": "Fighting the Taliban", "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}, {"friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "name": "wargames", "value": null}], "average": 7.5, "usersrated": 2, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.5, "expands": [], "numcomments": 2}, "42700": {"mechanics": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic481966.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 20, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": ["Giulia Canova"], "id": 42700, "yearpublished": 2009, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 2, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic481966_t.jpg", "publishers": ["TCS Games"], "families": ["Cities: Sparta (Greece)", "Country: Greece", "The Glory That Was Series"], "description": "The Glory That Was is a series of games depicting several different battles from the ancient world.\nVolume I, Greece, depicts a number of battles from the Persian War to the War of the Successors, while volume II, Rome, will have different battles from the Early Republic to the Late Roman Empire.\nAfter the Peloponnesian War, for around three decades Sparta was the uncontested military leader of the greek poleis, and considered almost invincible in an open field battle, for the strenght, the discipline and the courage of her hoplites.\nThe battles depicted in this \u201cepisode\u201d of our descent into the realm of the \u201cGlory that was Greece\u201d, both from 394 BC, testify the truth of this assertion, being both Spartan victories against coalitions of forces taken by several other Greek cities-states.\nMap scale will be variable, depending on the battle depicted, while each unit will normally represents from 100 to 1.000 infantry and from 25 to 250 cavalry or missile units.\n\nContains:\n2 8.5x11\" full color maps\n138 counters and markers\n14 Cards\n10 Page Rules in English\n1 Morale Chart\n\n", "minplayers": 0, "averageweight": 1.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Roberto Chiavini"], "categories": ["Ancient", "Print & Play", "Wargame"], "minage": 0, "name": "The Glory that Was Vol. I: Greece.

The miasmic shockwave of pure otherworldly magic spread outward from a point somewhere in the middle east, and in a few short hours plunged the entire globe into chaos. In those terrible moments, human civilization changed forever. \n\nMagic infused their very bones, manifested in their children, came unbidden to the fingertips of their women, and plagued their countryside in uncontrolled bursts of power. Ordinary beasts of the wilderness were turned by these bursts into fanciful creatures of legend. Entire tribes of humans from all corners of the world were altered by the flood of uncontrolled magic, changing before the very eyes of their friends and neighbors into elves, dwarves, orcs, trolls, centaurs, and even minotaurs. Creatures that normally existed between our reality and others were shunted into this one, leaving ghosts, faeries, and other magical creatures stranded in our world in ways they were never intended to be. Even remnants of the Old World, gods of the ancients and their ken, were awakened from their immortal slumber through this great cataclysm to trouble mankind once more.\n\nThe world had changed forever.\n\nThe year is now 37BCE and the middle-east sits at the center of a vast struggle to control humanity\u2019s fate. Three powerful nations have harnessed the power unleashed by the day of chaos, and they struggle to claim dominance over the known world. Their arcane legions are now yours to control.\n\nGameplay:\nIf you ever wondered what happened to the guys from WizKids just take a look at this game and you will know what they have been doing with the downtime after WizKids closed their doors.\n\nPlayers each field \"bases\" of variable sizes (Sortie/small and Formation/large) with individual figures inserted into starting positions on the base. The goal is to control victory point areas and inflict losses on the opponent. Movement and battle resolution are conducted through a unique formation management mechanic that allows players to move figures around on the unit bases to increase either movement/melee/ranged combat at the cost of losing capabilities in the other areas.\n\nCurrently wrapping up play-testing as of May 2009. Arcane Legions will be available in September of 2009. Initially, look for 3 different factions (Egyptians, Romans, and Han Dynasty).\n\nFigures are highly detailed true 25mm made from PVC 105. Common figures are unpainted with colored tempo prints on banners and shields, while all the uncommon, rare and Commander figures (Booster Pack contents) are fully pre-painted. The game is designed to use both types. There are 9 different unpainted common figures for each faction and at least 20 different fully painted premium figures for each faction. If you buy a legion bundle of a faction you receive around 70 prepainted figures, whereas buying one of each army pack gets you about 54 unpainted figures.\n\nWith more than 110 figures, the Starter Pack includes small armies for all three factions and enough formation bases, sortie bases and base cards for a complete two player game.  The Army Packs contain 40 common soldiers.  The Cavalry Packs contain 15 mounted figures.  The Booster Packs contain 5-10 (depending on the size) Leader / special figures and their associated base cards, plus five additional formation base cards for use with figures from the Army and Cavalry Packs.\n\nAll Arcane Legions products (with the exception of the Starter) can be purchased faction specific.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.375, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 5.68657, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Tyler Bielman", "Jonathon Loucks", "Ethan Pasternack", "Jordan Weisman"], "categories": ["Ancient", "Collectible Components", "Dice", "Fantasy", "Miniatures", "Mythology", "Wargame"], "minage": 10, "name": "Arcane Legions", "playingtime": 120, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": 3968}, {"friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "name": "wargames", "value": 1149}, {"friendlyname": "Customizable Rank", "name": "cgs", "value": 122}], "average": 6.45309, "usersrated": 259, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 1.87599, "expands": [], "numcomments": 129}, "42714": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic508755.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 7, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 42714, "yearpublished": 2009, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 1, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic508755_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Web published)"], "families": [], "description": "A free print and play dice game for two players.

This book is a stand alone set of rules based on it's predecessor Classical Hack III: Hack in the Dark and is profusely illustrated with diagrams, photographs and charts. Most players are able to play the game without much, if any, help after turn three. The primary change from First Edition is the use of a D-10 system from a percentile based casualty calculation. The first part of the book describes the basics of the game in regard to unit generation, movement and shooting. The remainder of the book is designed around the turn sequence. This takes the player basically through a typical turn describing each turn event in sequence.\n\nScale 1\" = 150' for 15mm and 25mm figures. Each turn = 15 to 20 minutes. Figure scale is flexible, from 5 to 200 men. Table size 4' x 6' or larger.\n\nThe end of the book contains a section on Special Add-on Tactics. There is also a general Q.R.S. or Quick Reference Sheet for playing the game. There are 39 Army Lists and four scenarios, plus play aids.

Over the following centuries, Europe was taken over. In the board game Opera, the players bring Opera to the public. In Venice, Vienna, Berlin, London, Paris and Milan great Opera houses arise. Opera leads the players through the periods of Baroque, Classicism and Romanticism. The epic music of six famous composers H\u00e4ndel, Monteverdi, Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner and Verdi will bring the public to their Opera houses.\n\nClever budgeting is essential to gain control and be the master of your own success. Each round the players determine their budget level to influence the order of play and to activate the characters in the game. The players build new Opera Houses, scout for new Operas of popular composers and try to earn some money. Sometimes they choose to cash in at the Palazzo where the Signora pays them well, but in the long term music are one of the key fundamentals to build your empire. The elegant Maestro brings the performance of an Opera to a higher level and the Critico can make or break a composer. Do not overvalue the three counting rounds with progressively growing value, because a well timed appearance of the Esperto might just bring you the victory in Opera. Ducats and capacity are key elements to facilitate the growth of your empire and influence, but in the end wealth is just an instrument to attain higher ends.\n\nIn Opera the players must plan well. Introducing an Intermezzo from time to time might be helpful to seize the initiative on a decisive moment in the game. Opera takes place over 9 rounds of play, divided in 3 episodes. Each episode consists of three playing rounds and a counting round. The player with the highest number of victory points after the third and last counting round will be the victor.\n\nOpera has been succesfully launched on October 21st, 2009. Complete rules are available in the English, Dutch and German language. Also a FAQ and an introductionary video to understand the basic rules of Opera can be found at http://www.thegamemaster.nl/en/games-opera.htm.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 3.2477, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 6.0677, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Hans van Tol"], "categories": ["Age of Reason", "Economic", "Music", "Renaissance"], "minage": 12, "name": "Opera", "playingtime": 90, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": 1722}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": 805}], "average": 6.65437, "usersrated": 920, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 1.4177, "expands": [], "numcomments": 293}, "42744": {"mechanics": ["Set Collection"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1584469.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 2, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": ["Silvia Christoph", "Tanja Donner", "Michaela Kienle"], "id": 42744, "yearpublished": 2007, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1584469_t.jpg", "publishers": ["KOSMOS"], "families": ["My Secret Unicorn"], "description": "One of a series of Kosmos games based on the My Secret Unicorn books by Linda Chapman.\n\nIn Germany, the series goes by the name, \"Sternenschweif\" (Star Tail) and the books are also published by Kosmos.\n\nLauras Zauberritt is based on the book in the series, with the same name.

New York Yankees World Series of  the 1950\u2018s.  All of the plays of  each of the games played in the two historic ballparks (Yankee Stadium and Ebbets Field) during the 1952, 1953, 1955, and 1956 World Series is \u201ccharted \u201c with mathematical accuracy for the chance of each event happening.  The game is a cleverly unique system that recreates the history of these series games. All of the actions that actually happened during the games from the 1952, 53, 55, and 56 series are charted onto the fields, and by a roll of the 3 dice (producing  216 different outcomes) these plays will happen according to the actual probability of such an event.  All of the ground outs, hits, (singles, doubles, triples, HR's), fly balls, line outs, strikeouts, walks, and errors! Anybody who is familiar with the \"Red Barber Baseball\" game of the 1950's will recognize the basic game system.\n\nThe game includes simple cardstock ballpark models of Yankee Stadium and Ebbets Field.  As well as Roster Sheets for both teams for 1952, 53, 55 and 56. These sheets include dice roll adjustments for each player in each park to better reflect each hitters achievements for each park during each year according to historical probability.  In many ways this is BASEBALL HISTORY at a glance.  Just looking at the ballpark recreations shows where all of the plays took place in each area of each park. This is a BASEBALL GAME which faithfully recreates the hitting exploits of each team in each ballpark, through all four of the Subway Series of the 1950's.\n\nAdditional infomation:\nThe game as originally published in 1988 came with a short \"history\" of the four World Series that was written especially for this game by Hall of Fame sportswriter Bob  Broeg of St.Louis.  Very few games were printed and they were used primarily as a promo for BAUER DIAMONDS (maker of model ballpark kits).

It tests your ability to predict how your opponents will act and your ability to judge the relative value of cards from one situation to the next. Also, it lets you do fun combos and be a panda. There are 10 characters to choose from, each with their own deck, abilities, and style. Each deck also doubles as a regular deck of playing cards with beautiful artwork (the complete game features a whopping 120 different character illustrations).\n\nYomi is the Japanese word for \u201creading\u201d, in this case as in reading the mind of your opponent. Yomi: Fighting Card Game is a simple competitive card game that simulates a fight between two characters. Each deck in Yomi represents one character, with 10 decks in the first release.\n\nChampion fighting game tournament player and tournament organizer David Sirlin designed the game to test the skills of Valuation and Yomi. Valuation refers to your ability to judge the relative value of moves (or cards) as they change over the course of the game. Yomi, the game's title, refers to your ability to guess which moves your opponent will make. There is more to it than guessing, though: some players have the uncanny ability to \u201cguess\u201d right almost every time, no matter the game.\n\nThe core mechanic is a paper-rock-scissors guessing game between attack, throw, and block/dodge (sometimes modified by special ability cards). Attacks and throws usually let you follow up with combo cards from your hand, while blocks let you draw a card. While it first seems \"just random,\" you soon discover that the unequal and uncertain payoffs in this guessing game allow you really read what the opponent will do.

In general he/she who gets most food, plays last. First player expands with least food.\n\nPhase 2: Players expand on the board to earn points or money.\n\nPlayers begin to form strings and/or clusters of huts and pay for placing them with their food cards. Depending on where huts are placed, they either score points or earn camels (money).\n\nPhase 3: Players spend money/camels on various investments.\n\nA player either goes for one-time bonuses from the nobles of Assur, or makes long-term investments by offerings to gods and building Ziggurats.\n\nThe game lasts for three eras, made up of 2-3 of such cycles.

The focus is on the Thirty Years War, but it is certainly possible to use them for other conflicts as well. Examples of these include, but are not limited to: the English Civil War and the wars between Sweden and Poland. I have intentionally left the late 17th century out, as I feel this period is better covered by the standard rules.\n\n\"My ambition has been to include enough new/changed elements to produce the right \"period feel\". The game should not feel like a WSS game with different figures. I have tried to do it as I haven\u00e2\u0080\u009ft found a set of rules that deal with the 30YW in a way I like, and because I felt that G\u00e5 P\u00e5 actually could be used to cover the period - although with some changes needed.\n\n\"Because of this I have decided to change some of the unit type names, and create new ones as well. My hope is that this doesn\u00e2\u0080\u009ft create too much confusion, but instead generates more period feel.\n\n\"In the 17th century units tended to use deeper formations.

Game is available in print and play version and also via e-book.\n\nFrom the Downey Games website:\n\n\"Fast Lane Racing is the culmination of two years worth of design and testing.\n\nWith Fast Lane Racing, we\u2019ve covered all of the bases.  Every element of open wheel racing is covered from qualifying right down to the checkered flag.\n\nIn Fast Lane racing, drivers are rated separately for qualifying and racing, giving you an extremely accurate picture of each and every driver to get behind the wheel in the 2008 season.  To further enhance the realism, each driver is rated for the various track types run in the open wheel series.  Drivers are also rated for their ability to lead laps, how they perform during pit stops, and tendency to avoid mechanical failures.  You truly get an accurate representation of each driver.\n\nAll tracks are individually rated as well.  Each track is rated for Pole Position Speed, number of caution flags, Racing Speed, and weather.\n\nSpeaking of weather; how many times have you watched a race and heard the drivers and commentators talk about how the track has changed due to weather?  In Fast Lane Racing, we\u2019ve replicated this most important facet of racing.  You\u2019ll see the effects of a green track following heavy rains.  You\u2019ll see drivers run faster laps at Indianapolis as the track closes and the track cools.\n\nAnd speaking of Indianapolis, we have replicated EVERY facet of the unique qualifying format of the world\u2019s most famous race, right down to the bumping into the field!\n\nFast Lane Racing is not a quick play game.  However, we\u2019ve compressed the racing into the most exciting elements, giving you a game that plays quickly.  With Fast Lane Racing, you\u2019ll be able to realistically complete an entire season.  A typical race and qualifying session takes approximately 40 to 60 minutes total.  If you use actual qualifiers and only run the races, you\u2019ll consistently finish within 20 minutes.  And while we have compressed the racing, we have not cut corners.  You\u2019ll \u201csee\u201d every detail of the race unfold right on your tabletop!\n\nEach Fast Lane Racing Year Book contains everything you need to play.  There are no external \u201cgame parts\u201d to buy.\n\nThe printed games feature individual, die-cut driver and track cards, with everything packed in a sturdy game box.\"\n\n", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Chris Fry"], "categories": ["Racing", "Sports"], "minage": 8, "name": "Fast Lane Racing", "playingtime": 20, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 0.0, "usersrated": 0, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 1}, "43191": {"mechanics": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic491435.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 43191, "yearpublished": 1967, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic491435_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Milton Bradley"], "families": ["Comics: DC Universe", "Superheroes"], "description": "2 game combo with one side of the board with Superman and the other side with Superboy.

It consistently ranks among the greatest films of all time; in 2007 it ranked at #34 in a list of 100 and was the only animated film in the list. In 1989 the film was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" Like other Disney projects, spin-off marketing soon created related merchandise. Products introduced in 1937 included \"The Game of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" from Milton Bradley Company. A complicated game with several different playing pieces and multiple types of rules, the game attempts to mimic the plot of the movie. The winning player's Snow White playing piece triumphs at the end with a kiss from the handsome prince.\n\nDescription courtesy of thestrong.org (Creative Commons, BY-NC-ND)\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "minage": 0, "name": "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs", "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 6.0, "usersrated": 1, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 1}, "43194": {"mechanics": [], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic491456.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 43194, "yearpublished": 1930, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic491456_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Milton Bradley"], "families": [], "description": "Very small game recreating the favorite outdoor game.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["Action / Dexterity", "Sports"], "minage": 0, "name": "Shuffleboard", "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 7.8, "usersrated": 1, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 0}, "43195": {"mechanics": ["Hand Management"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic491459.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 0, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 43195, "yearpublished": 1915, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic491459_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Milton Bradley"], "families": ["Scouting / Guiding"], "description": "\"Produced under License of Boy Scouts of America\"\n\nCard game of boy scouting.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Children's Game"], "minage": 0, "name": "Game of Scouting for Boy Scouts", "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 0.0, "usersrated": 0, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 0}, "43196": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic546711.jpg", "wishing": 47, "owned": 314, "expansions": [], "trading": 6, "artists": ["Todd Davis"], "id": 43196, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 18, "wanting": 17, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic546711_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Compass Games"], "families": ["Country: Korea"], "description": "In November of 1950, the United Nations counteroffensive against the North Koreans seemed to be in the final stages of a mop-up. Everywhere the Inmun Gun (the North Korean Army) was in full retreat toward the Chinese border, closely pursued by the victorious Allies.\n\nChinese intervention in the war had been considered and dismissed as a bluff by the UN Command. Thus, the UN forces were badly overextended when the bluff materialized as a force of thirty divisions, having infiltrated into the Korean mountains.\n\nUN forces were sent reeling back to the 38th Parallel in confusion, attempting to reestablish a front line. The Communists followed relentlessly, infiltrating deep into UN positions. They attacked without caution, accepting high casualties in order to sustain momentum.\n\nUnits in Yalu are mostly divisions, with some regiments and battalions. Ground scale is 10 miles per hex and turns are weekly. Weather plays a predominant role, influencing movement and combat options for both sides. Yalu, like no other game, effectively shows the differences in the opposing sides' Rules of Engagement - the two sides simply feel and play differently.\n\nThis is the second edition of Yalu; the first was published in GDW's Conflict Games line in 1977. The 2009, Second Edition of Yalu will be a fully updated version of the game with all new graphics, all known errata included and some additional rule updates.\n\nBoth \"New-Look\" and \"Retro-Look\" components. Second Edition Yalu has both \"New-Look\" and \"Retro-Look\" map and counters to provide some replay variability. The 1977 rules and the new rules will also be featured.\n\n\nRe-implements:\n\n     Yalu: The Chinese Counteroffensive in Korea, November 1950 to May 1951\n\n\n\n\n", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 2.9444, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 5.62031, "implementations": [], "designers": ["John Hill (I)"], "categories": ["Korean War", "Wargame"], "minage": 12, "name": "Yalu: The Chinese Counteroffensive in Korea: November 1950-May 1951 (second edition)", "playingtime": 600, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": 5074}, {"friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "name": "wargames", "value": 859}], "average": 7.30126, "usersrated": 70, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 1.3274, "expands": [], "numcomments": 48}, "43197": {"mechanics": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic491471.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 3, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 43197, "yearpublished": 1942, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic491471_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Selchow & Righter"], "families": [], "description": "Roll and move game with a cool little flag.

Poke was published in Esquire Magazine in 1946, and he published Slam himself in 1951. Slam, since it has more rules, came in an approximately 4\"x2\" white paper booklet. Both of these games would be reprinted in Sackson's book A Gamut of Games in 1969, while Triad would appear (slightly modified) as Pe-Ling in 1970. Triad was then published in GAMES magazine in 1986, while Pe-Ling was presented at Spiel in 1989 and in included in an issue #5 of Spielbox in 1990.\n\nTriad is similar to Mah Jongg, but uses a special deck made from two decks of cards using only the ace through 8 of each suit. For four players, a third set of cards is added. The rules mostly detail scoring for the various hands that can be formed.\n\nIn this game, players try to combine twelve cards in three sets of four cards, each set belonging to one of the three classes allowed. To do this, players can choose to take a face-up card from the draw pile or a face-down card from the discard pile. A set of the Class 1 type consists of four cards of the same suit. For Class 2 sets, each four cards should be arranged as two pairs, with the sum of the values being 9 (e.g., 2, 2 and 7, 7). Class 3 is about making groups of four cards of the same number (e.g., 2, 2, 2, 2). In each Class, some cards combinations are considered weak, easy or strong, giving 2, 4 or 8 points, respectively. Moreover, there are several conditions and card combinations that add doubling factors progressively to the total sum. In this way, one doubling multiplies the points by a factor of 2, two by 4, three by 8, etc. The game lasts several rounds until a player reaches a predetermined amount of points.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Sid Sackson"], "categories": ["Card Game"], "minage": 0, "name": "Triad", "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 4.0, "usersrated": 1, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 1}, "43221": {"mechanics": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic491627.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 1, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 43221, "yearpublished": 1959, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic491627_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Chad Valley"], "families": ["Country: France", "Desert Theme"], "description": "French Foreign Legion racing against Arab tribesmen for control of the desert forts.

As in life, fate is decided by aggression, instinct and luck.\n\nDescription:\n\nIn Infecta each player controls a cell made up of a nucleus piece and many cell wall pieces. Each player also controls six virions (virus particles) which can destroy other pieces; the object is to destroy the opponent's nucleus, all the opponent's virions, or all the opponent's cell walls.\n\nOn a turn the active player rolls two dice and moves pieces accordingly. Virions can only move in straight lines, and each one must use the full amount rolled on one die. The other pieces can split dice and move in any combination of directions desired. Rolling doubles entitles a player to another turn (though this cannot be repeated) and also to restore a destroyed virion under certain conditions.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Ken Totten"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "minage": 8, "name": "Infecta", "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}, {"friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "name": "abstracts", "value": null}], "average": 4.6, "usersrated": 2, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 1.6, "expands": [], "numcomments": 0}, "43350": {"mechanics": ["Auction/Bidding", "Co-operative Play", "Worker Placement"], "median": 0.0, "image": null, "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 43350, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": null, "publishers": ["(Unpublished)"], "families": [], "description": "Players try to build up a Frontier Town's population before the Railroad reaches the town, whilst battling against hired guns, bandits, the railroad company and, most of all, themselves.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Matthew Midgley"], "categories": ["American West"], "minage": 10, "name": "Frontier Town", "playingtime": 90, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 0.0, "usersrated": 0, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 0}, "43351": {"mechanics": [], "median": 0.0, "image": null, "wishing": 1, "owned": 0, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 43351, "yearpublished": 2006, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": null, "publishers": ["Clash of Steel"], "families": [], "description": "Roar of the Crowd provides easy-to-learn Gladiatorial combat rules for 2-6 players, ages 12 and up.

The units of the IDF 401st Brigade had been waiting for weeks for orders as they sat taking incoming Hezbollah attacks. Orders had come in twice to proceed and twice were cancelled. The canyon like Saluki is a \"gateway to the Litani river\", an essential objective in southern Lebanon assigned to the brigade before the cease-fire went into action. On August 11, just before 1500 hours, orders came in, but at this late stage, made no sense to the brigade staff. Crossing the Saluki meant the troops and tanks had to climb a steep hill while exposed to attack from mountains on every side. Understanding the risk to tanks, Division 162 deployed its Nahal Brigade infantry on the high ground outside the villages Ghandouriya and Farun, to provide cover for the armored column advancing below. The distance from one plateau to another across the steep valley is only a half mile. Both towns that the IDF attempted to screen were still in enemy hands and both a good half mile from the edge of the Saluki Valley. Russian-made AT- 14 Kornet anti-tank missiles waited en-masse in excellent firing positions. IDF tanks would attempt to climb along a narrow dirt track just below this area! There would be no air support nor artillery support.

The Bastiano army counter-attacked in June of 1958, driving the Guerrillas back into the mountains. When the Bastiano army attempted to destroy the Guerrillas in their mountain strongholds, the Bastiano army was all but destroyed itself. With all the newly acquired weapons, the Guerrillas launched a final offensive that ended in the only major battle of the war at the town of Santa Clara. The defeat of the Bastiano Western forces caused the rest of the army to begin deserting. When Fulgencia Batista fled in January of 1959, the Guerrillas triumphantly declared the island was officially free. The improbable victory of the Guerrillas resulted in the only communist country in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nCHE: In March, 1967 the situation in Bolivia was chaotic and the country was ripe for the exportation of \"The Cuban Revolution\".  Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara was sent to Bolivia to begin a revolution which ultimately failed due to the intervention of the CIA and US Green Berets who trained three elite Bolivian ranger battalions who captured \"Che\" Guevara and later executed him thus ending the Communist threat in Bolivia.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Dennis Bishop", "Andrew Preziosi"], "categories": ["Modern Warfare", "Wargame"], "minage": 12, "name": "Communism in the West: Cuba 1958 and Boliva 1967", "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 6.33333, "usersrated": 3, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 1.69967, "expands": [], "numcomments": 2}, "43526": {"mechanics": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic784196.jpg", "wishing": 54, "owned": 637, "expansions": [], "trading": 16, "artists": ["Alonzo Chappel", "Rodger B.

In addition to more Destination, Crisis, Super Crisis, Loyalty, and Skill Cards, this expansion introduces many new card types such as Treachery Skill Cards, representing the underhanded methods used to sabotage humanity's struggles. New characters in the expansion allow players to play as Cylon Leaders, who can win or lose based on their own mysterious motivations. New gameboards allow characters to explore both the Pegasus and New Caprica. Finally, with the New Caprica Objective Card and board, humanity will be subjected to Cylon rule, and must defend themselves from their oppressive overlords until Galactica can return to attempt a daring rescue.\n\n\"We fight 'em until we can't.\" - Kara Thrace\n\nExpands:\n\n\n    Battlestar Galactica\n\n\n", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 3.2759, "expansion": true, "bayesaverage": 7.37902, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Daniel Clark (I)", "Corey Konieczka", "Tim Uren"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Deduction", "Expansion for Base-game", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Negotiation", "Political", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration", "Spies/Secret Agents"], "minage": 13, "name": "Battlestar Galactica: Pegasus Expansion", "playingtime": 180, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}, {"friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "name": "thematic", "value": null}], "average": 7.79819, "usersrated": 4595, "alternative_names": ["Battlestar Galactica: Espansione Pegasus", "Battlestar Galactica: Expansi\u00f3n Pegasus", "Battlestar Galactica: Extension Pegasus", "Battlestar Galactica: Pegasus Rozszerzenie", "Battlestar Galactica: Pegasus \u2013 Erweiterung", "\u592a\u7a7a\u5821\u5792\u5361\u62c9\u72c4\u52a0\uff1a\u5e15\u52a0\u7d22\u65af"], "stddev": 1.39873, "expands": [{"id": 37111, "name": "Battlestar Galactica"}], "numcomments": 1076}, "43540": {"mechanics": ["Memory"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic499265.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 43540, "yearpublished": 1988, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic499265_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Holdson"], "families": [], "description": "Enjoy all the excitement of real Lotto in this fun-to-play game.

At that time, as his forces are completing the conquest of Poland, Hitler receives a flash of intuition. That is, he can\u2019t help but notice the strategic paralysis of the Anglo-French, who do nothing to try to prevent the downfall of their fast-disappearing eastern ally Poland. From that he concludes it would be a waste of time to redeploy the Wehrmacht to the western front in 1940. He tells his generals: \u201cThe time will never be better to destroy the Bolshevik power than in the coming year. We will continue to have nothing to fear in the west. The British and French simply do not want war; they are afraid of it. Once we\u2019ve taken Moscow, we\u2019ll take Paris and London by telephone.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, he also tells his foreign minister to drop all negotiations aimed at revising the original territorial split set out in the accords with the USSR the previous month. Most importantly, Lithuania, originally in the German \u201csphere of interest,\u201d is not traded for a further slice of Polish territory.\n\nAll of which has resulted in this low-complexity, strategic-level, alternative history wargame. In it, two to four players can investigate the possibilities inherent in a changed German strategy for 1940. The West Front map is scaled at 16 miles per hexagon. The Eastern Front map is scaled at 25 miles per hex. All Soviet units are armies; all other forces in the game are corps. Each game turn on both maps equals half a month.\n\nThis game can be played by two, three or four. If two play, one commands the Germans, while the other commands both the Anglo-French and Soviets. If played by three, one player commands the Germans, one player commands the Anglo-French, and the third commands the Soviets. If four play, one player commands the Germans on the west map; the second commands the Germans on the east map; the third commands the Soviets, and the fourth commands the Anglo-French.

Players move through a Mayan temple, risking constant death while trying to get to the exit, carrying as much treasure as they dare. The more treasure cards you have, the fewer actions you might get this round. If your character gets killed, a second one can drop in and you may still get enough treasure and escape to win.\n\nThe temple starts with a room of crushing walls, leading into a winding passage that takes you past a lava pit and locked alcoves. The passage goes on, with two short-cuts that might save you time; a fast river or a rickety wooden bridge. You must balance attempts to grab treasure from the rooms, as you pass through, with staying ahead of a massive boulder, tumbling down the passage after you. If you have to let the boulder pass or be crushed to death, then you're forced to jump in the river and risk drowning just to get ahead. Otherwise, the boulder reaches the exit before you, blocking it and you're trapped forever.\n\nA mix of very basic lucky dice-rolling, lucky card draw for the treasure, and some decision-making about possible risks.

Players who can cover rows, columns or diagonal lines on their boards get points, whoever has most points in the end, wins.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Manfred Ludwig"], "categories": ["Animals", "Bluffing", "Children's Game"], "minage": 4, "name": "Schummeltier", "playingtime": 5, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 0.0, "usersrated": 0, "alternative_names": ["La b\u00eate \u00e0 triche", "L'imbroglio"], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 0}, "44844": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic949954.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 4, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 44844, "yearpublished": 1985, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic949954_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Spiel mit"], "families": ["Animals: Pigs"], "description": "This is a race of rubber pigs and their owners (wooden meeples).

Each game lasts around 20 minutes.\n\nAn adaptoid is a creature that constantly evolves to adapt itself to its surroundings. To survive it needs to be fed. In adaptoid, two armies of adaptoids must confront one another with the aim of eliminating all opponents.\n\nThe game is played on a 37-space hexagonal board. Each player receives a supply of adaptoid bodies in either white or black which are plastic discs with laser-cut sockets ready to receive one of the small pile of claws and legs in the colour of each player. The capabilities of each of the adaptoids varies through the game depending on how many and what type of appendage are added.\n\nEach player turn has 3 phases: Movement, Growth and Feeding. In the movement phase, the player may move one of their adaptoids as many spaces as it has limbs. Adaptoids cannot move through occupied spaces, but they can move on top of an opposing adaptoid to initiate a capture.\n\nIn the growth phase the player must either spawn a new, empty, adaptoid next to one of their existing pieces or add a leg or a claw to any adaptoid already on the board.\n\nIn the feeding phase, every enemy piece is checked for starvation. An adaptoid requires space to graze equal to its number of limbs. Any enemy piece which has fewer empty spaces around it than limbs starves to death and is removed. Starving your opponent to death (or indeed having them incautiously starve themselves) is worth a point.\n\nThe resolution of capture move is simple. The adaptoid with the most claws wins and the other adaptoid is removed from the board. If both pieces have the same number of claws, both are removed with a point going to each player.

Can your guild sweep through its districts and gain power through recruiting influential citizens and acquiring valuable relics?\n\nThe revised edition of Arcana is a card game of recruitment and resource gathering for 2-4 crafty leaders. Command a guild of loyal agents during a series of district encounters against your opponents. Score the most prominent citizens, advantageous locations, and valuable treasures through bribery and power struggles. Collect the highest amount of victory points to become the master guild of Cadwallon!\n\nThis vibrant game creates a fantastical atmosphere for players to enjoy while they attempt to best their opponents through strategic card play. Make your guild the most influential by winning Stake cards and strengthening your deck with impressive Personalities, advantageous Locations, or tempting Relics to use in bribery.\n\nThe revised edition of Arcana introduces two new guilds to choose from, the Guild of Fortune-tellers and the Guild of Architects, as well a variety of optional rules that players can utilize to enhance their experience. Players can customize their guild, fulfill objectives, recruit Militia, invoke the ability of their Guild Masters, affect game play through random events, or optimize tactical strategy through card discards. Which variant will you use in your game?\n\nSummary of Play\n\nArcana is played over a series of rounds that are comprised of two phases, the Intrigue phase and the Resolution phase. Send Agents from your unique guild deck to any of Cadwallon\u2019s districts to claim control of Stake cards: Personalities, Locations, and Relics, all of which award victory points.\n\nDuring these district encounters players gain control of Stake cards by playing their Agent cards. Stake cards are won through meeting or exceeding the card\u2019s main arcanum: either Military, Political, Spiritual, or Financial. Whichever Agent has the highest matching arcanum type wins the current revealed Stake card in that district.\n\nOf course if the Stake card you are after is a Personality card you can choose to bribe them with a Relic Card instead, immediately ending the phase and wresting the victory points from your opponents should you succeed.\n\nPlayers can increase the mystery of the final outcome through bluffing. Players control two friendly distracts (piles of Stake cards) in which they can place their Agents facedown.

All trade roads can be used by all players. Shipping fees are payed to the 'shipping company' that controls that trade road. There's shipping by sea as well, which works a tiny little bit differently.\n\nThe players, rich merchants, decide which shipping company invests where and how. They do this by buying cubes of the color of that shipping company. The cubes bought can be put on the map as sections of trade roads (or harbors), or they can be kept in the player's stock as 'influence' in that shipping company. The profits of a shipping company are divided by ratio of such influence cubes. Hence, owning more cubes means a larger share of the profit. However, a shipping company can only make a profit if it has many trade roads, many cubes on the map. Therefore, cube hoarders get a large share of nothing, and a player that spends all his cubes on roads gets a tiny share or even nothing of - potentially - a lot.\n\nOf course, the profit a shipping company makes is entirely dependent on whether the roads (and harbors) of that company are actually used. Players decide what to ship from what location to what other location. Of course, the choice is driven by profit maximization.\nThere are 10 locations on the map. 7 of these are Chinese cities. The other 3 are foreign locations. In all locations, three (out of five total) goods are traded. Prices are set randomly at the beginning of the game, but after that they depend on trade. Buying goods in a market makes the price of that good increase. Selling goods in a market makes the price of that good decrease.\n\nAnd, rather importantly, all players (secretly) plan their trades at the same time.

The new start tile is the size of 16 tiles, arranged in a 4\u00d74 square and is built using some of the tiles removed from the base game.\n\nNineteen tiles from the game have numbers printed on them allowing players to randomly spin the Wheel of Fate (between 1 and 3 spaces around the wheel). Otherwise, a player may choose to place a follower on the wheel if they decline placing a follower that turn. The results of the Wheel vary depending on which of the sixths of the wheel the pig lands on. Results vary from forcing all players to remove a follower from the board to rewarding the player who moves the pig with three bonus points. There are six outcomes in all.\n\nPlay of this game does not require ownership of any Carcassonne base game. All expansions are compatible with this game. This game can also be played with the base game as an expansion, using its wagon wheel watermark to differentiate it from the base game.\n\nThe German edition of this game includes a book Carcassonne -\u00a0Das Schicksalsrad by Helene Luise K\u00f6ppel.\n\nThe English edition of the game was released in October 2009 by Rio Grande Games.\n\nPart of the Carcassonne series.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0667, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 6.25624, "implementations": ["Carcassonne"], "designers": ["Klaus-J\u00fcrgen Wrede"], "categories": ["City Building", "Medieval", "Territory Building"], "minage": 8, "name": "Carcassonne: Wheel of Fortune", "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": 1251}, {"friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "name": "familygames", "value": 279}], "average": 7.07322, "usersrated": 849, "alternative_names": ["Carcassonne: Das Schicksalsrad", "Carcassonne: Het Rad van Fortuin"], "stddev": 1.38748, "expands": [], "numcomments": 218}, "45749": {"mechanics": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic505927.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 3, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": ["Richard A.

The game is a demo version of the game, Devil's Due, Brice's Crossroads. This will allow you to test drive the Rebel Yell system in general and the upcoming game in particular, at no cost.\n Tha game is about one of the most lopsided victories in the war for the Confederates. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest was a threat to General Sherman's vulnerable and strung out supply line during his Georgia March to the Sea in 1864.\n A detachment of 8000 Union soldiers, a mix of cavalry & infantry, were sent to eliminate Forrest's troops.\n The over eager young Union officer, Samuel Sturgis, sent his cavalry over 7 miles in front of his infantry.\n Forrest predicted the battle's outcome early that day to one of his generals. He stated that their Confederate cavalry would drive the Union cavalry back in a rout and push them into the tired Union infantry slogging their way towards the battlefield. His prediction was true as the Union cavalry quickly broke and retreated right back into the confused infantry. The infantry could not organize a stand in the panicked retreat of the horsemen. The Union troops were routed and suffered casualties that exceed the CSA losses by 3 to 1.\n In the end though, Forrest was not able to interfere with the supply line of Sherman's army, so in this, Sherman's goal was accomplished.\n This game comes with 2 scenarios, the simplified rules, 2 maps (in four pieces), counter images and needed charts. A 10 sided die will need to be supplied. The counters will need to be mounted on cardboard.\n Scenario 1 is Forrest Attacks! It depicts the initial routing of the US cavalry and is played on map 1.\n Scenario 2 is Drive on Brice's Store and is played on map 2. \nThe 2 scenarios can be played as a 'campaign' game. This would require the CSA player to win both or the Union will be victorious.\n\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Richard A.

This book is concerned with the two great Chaos Powers Tzeentch and Nurgle, their Daemons, and their mortal Champions. The other two major Chaos Powers, Khorne and Slaanesh, have already been described in Slaves to Darkness, volume one of Realm of Chaos.\n\nWarhammer Fantasy Battle players can use this book to create their own Champions of Chaos - mortal heroes whose mighty deeds have won them the deserving patronage of the Chaos Powers. As a Champion of Chaos, your hero will earn special rewards from his patron, including super-human abilities, magical gifts, and daemonic followers. In return for his Patron's favour, your Champion must undertake to fight rival Champions and further the divine aims of his Chaos Power in the mortal world.\n\nWarhammer Fantasy Battle players can also use this book to create Daemonic Armies of the Chaos Powers Nurgle and Tzeentch. Daemonic Armies are so tremendously powerful and highly magical that they are only suitable for fighting each other. This they do more or less continuously as their masters pitch them against each other to test their relative strengths. Champions of Chaos who have grown sufficiently powerful may be summoned to the daemonic battlefield to fight on behalf of their patron.\n\nWarhammer 40,000 players can also create their own Champions to fight each other or any of the other forces of the Imperium. Players can also use this book to design armies of Chaos Renegades and Traitor Marines which confront the Imperium for control of the galaxy.\n\nWarhammer Fantasy Roleplay players can use this book either to create an unusual character type in the Chaos Champion, or to generate endless adversaries for more conventional characters. The narrative generators can also be used as the basis for adventures against or on behalf of the Chaos Powers, and also provide many ideas which you can develop into game plots yourself.\n\n\nUser Summary:\n\nThe second part of Realm of Chaos detailing the gods of chaos in Games Workshop's various universes. Weighed in at 300 pages.\n\nOriginally written for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, Games Workshop had lost some of the IP rights to that world and so promptly quit officially supporting it.\n\nOfficially listed as only a supplement for Warhammer Fantasy Battles and Warhammer 40,000, the background material was only useful for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. Also, there were Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay stats provided for all the creature included herein.\n\nFocused on the gods Nurgle and Tzeentch, The Lost and the Damned included extensive rules on \"narrative campaigns\".\n\nHowever, the one bad thing about this book was the binding was exceedingly brittle, and the pages very easily separated from it with just minimal use of the book. Plus, unlike Slaves to Darkness, it was never reprinted.\n\n", "minplayers": 0, "averageweight": 4.0, "expansion": true, "bayesaverage": 5.6598, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Bryan Ansell", "Rick Priestley"], "categories": ["Book", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy", "Miniatures", "Science Fiction"], "minage": 0, "name": "Realm of Chaos: The Lost and the Damned", "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}, {"friendlyname": "RPG Item Rank", "name": "rpgitem", "value": null}], "average": 7.87566, "usersrated": 76, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 1.65509, "expands": [{"id": 4192, "name": "Warhammer"}, {"id": 11106, "name": "Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader"}], "numcomments": 21}, "46089": {"mechanics": ["Simulation"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic509003.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 46089, "yearpublished": 1940, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic509003_t.jpg", "publishers": ["E.S.

Employing a new take on card driven game systems, each player will create a unique deck that represents their advice to their candidate. The players will struggle to influence voters in the critical swing states from this election, while targeting key constituencies that just might put them over the top. Players will try to define the key issue in the states. Will McCain dominate the national security debate, or can Obama play on people's fears over the economy? As the campaign manager of a national presidential campaign, you will either identify the road to the White House, or the road to irrelevance.\n\nUser review: The object of the game (and it is a game, not a simulation) is to lead your candidate, John McCain or Barack Obama, to victory by getting 270 electoral votes. Twenty battleground states are up for grabs in this game of cardplay.\n\nEach player has a deck of forty five Campaign Strategy cards; only fifteen can be used in the game. (The rules suggest a selected fifteen cards for novices.) Each player also has a deck of ten battleground state tiles. Each player will select two of their states to put into play. (again, the rules make a suggestion for novices.)\nIn turn, a player either plays a card from one's own hand and follows the instructions on it or draws a card if fewer than five are already held.\n\nTo win a state, a player must get complete support from the state's voters in the issue which has more support of the people. Each state also has two key demographics. A shift in which demographic takes precidence also may affect the effect of a player's cards.\n\nSome cards require players to go \"negative.\" These cards require the opponent to roll a die and the result may give the opponent an unintended benefit.\n\nWhenever a player wins a state, the electoral votes are added to that candidate's tally. A state is brought into play by the winning manager and chance card is put into effect.\n\nThe game is over when one manager scores 270 electoral votes. That player is the winner.

The Father is always on the upper line; the Mother is on the lower.  The numbering system begins with the person whose ancestry is being sought.  Number 2 on the chart is the searcher's father; Number 3 is his or her mother, etc.  It will also be noted that all male names have even numbers and all female names have odd numbers.  Another interesting fact is that each father is double the number of his child.  Hence if Number 2 is a Smith, Number 4, 8, 16, 32 etc. would also be Smiths.

A game for any number of players.\nEach player in turn throws the five dice. The score is noted but a 2 or a 5 score zero points and the offending die is removed. The player throws again with the number of dice that didn't score 2 or 5. This score is added to his first throw. This process continues until finally the player throws 2 or 5 with his remaining di(c)e, thus losing them and ending his throw. His final tally is recorded and the 5 dice are given to the next player to construct his score. The winner is the person who scored the highest total in a set number of turns or predetermined time.\n\nYankee Grab: A game for 3 or 4 players using 3 dice.\nEach player in turn throws the three dice. The highest of these is set aside, and the player rolls the two remaining dice. The highest of these is set aside again. These two numbers are totalled and then multiplied by the last dice after it has been thrown again. The score is noted and the next player has his three throws.\nThe player with the highest score wins the round. It is traditional to play 10 rounds with the winner having won the majority of rounds.\n\n5000: A game for any number of players using 6 dice.\nThe object of the game is to accumulate 5000 points. The dice score as follows:\nAny 5 scores 50 points\nAny 1 scores 100 points\nThree 2's score 200\nStraight 1 to 6 scores 1500\n6 of a kind = instant win 5000 points\nThree 5's score 500 points\nThree 6's score 600 points\nThree 1's score 1000 points\n3 pairs score 500 points\n\nTo play: The 1st player throws the 6 dice. The dice which score are set to one side and the remaining dice can be thrown again. Scoring dice are again put to one side. This can be repeated as many times as necessary. A player does not have to put aside all scoring dice if he does not wish. In each turn a player must score at least 350. This is called the BASE SCORE. After the base score is reached the player has the option to STICK or continue throwing. If he sticks the points scored in that turn are noted and play passes to the next player. With each throw of the dice at least one die must score and increase the point count of that turn or the whole score for that turn is lost, and play passes to the next player. If all 6 dice score and have been placed to one side, all six may be thrown again. One can continue as long as the score is improved with each throw.\nWhen a player has stuck or lost his turn, the dice pass to the next player, who must either score 'base' ot at least 50 points more than the previous player's score for that turn, whichever is greatest. Failure to do so means that the score for that round is lost.\n\nRotation: A game for any number of players using 2 dice.\nThe possible totals that two dice can make are: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.\nThere are 11 rounds to this game - one for each total. In teh first round the players each try and score a total of 2. If he suceeds 2 is added to his score. In the second round players try to score a total of 3 etc. E,g. in round 7 when players are trying to achieve a total of 8, a player throws a 5 and a 3. 8 points are therefore added to his score. The person with the highest total after 11 rounds is the winner.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["Dice"], "minage": 8, "name": "Shipmates Dice Games", "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 3.55, "usersrated": 2, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 1.55, "expands": [], "numcomments": 3}, "46530": {"mechanics": ["Betting/Wagering", "Dice Rolling", "Trick-taking", "Variable Player Powers"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic843275.jpg", "wishing": 135, "owned": 854, "expansions": [{"id": 172873, "name": "The Red Dragon Inn: Eve's Mystery Mead"}], "trading": 23, "artists": ["Kennon James"], "id": 46530, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 8, "numweights": 6, "wanting": 27, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic843275_t.jpg", "publishers": ["SlugFest Games"], "families": ["The Red Dragon Inn"], "description": "From the publisher:\n\nThe Red Dragon Inn: Gambling I'm In! is a game about the games that the heroes play when they gamble at the Red Dragon Inn. Now, players of The Red Dragon Inn, The Red Dragon Inn 2, The Red Dragon Inn 3, and The Red Dragon Inn 4 can play out an actual round of gambling when they play the \"Gambling? I'm In!\" card! Even better, the gambling games also can be played on their own as standalone games, or as part of your RPG, or LARP. The game will come with a 93 card Rogues and Warriors Deck, a bunch of 6 sided dice, coin tokens, debt and loan tokens and rules for at least 7 games! Some of the games use dice. Some of the games use cards from the Rogues and Warriors Deck, and some of the games use dice and cards.\n\nThis card deck was developed as a stand-alone game as well as a possible replacement to the gambling component in Red Dragon Inn 1 and 2.\n\nThe deck consists of 90 cards. The deck is broken down into three colors (rust, green, and blue) with 6 different symbols. The card faces feature 1 Knight, 2 Ladys, 3 Bards, 4 Merchants, and 5 Rogues per card symbol. There is a die symbol on each card with a number of pips equal to the number of cards of its type and a set of symbols on the right that denote character superiority in certain game variations. Some games with this deck involve 6 D6 dice (not included).\n\nThere are five base games included and are as follows:\n\n\n     Rogues and Warriors - Similar to two card poker, each player is dealt two cards. You compare these two cards to the symbols on the right to determine how powerful your hand is.\n     Threes - Uses all dice, no cards. \n     Jack of All Trades - Uses 5 dice and only the Rogue and Warrior cards. The theme is putting your workers to work and using the cards and dice to complete jobs.\n     Den of Thieves - No dice. Hands are dealt and players use the special abilities of each character to influence hand weight and scoring.\n     The Wheel (and The Clock) - No dice. Players try to guess what cards others are collecting in order to gain points and win the round.\n\n\nWhen combined with The Red Dragon games, when a player plays the \"Gambling, I'm in!\" card, the player may decide to choose any game from the list to play instead of the normal gambling rules. Special rules are included for each variation when combining this with the normal game.\n\nThere will be other variations available as Slugfest has invited players to create their own games with the deck and the ones deemed best will be included in later rules updates.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 5.58965, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Cliff Bohm", "Jeff Morrow", "Sam Waller"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Fantasy"], "minage": 15, "name": "The Red Dragon Inn: Gambling?

The map encompasses the entire theater of war from the English Channel to the Swiss Border. The game system used is a streamlined derivative of the 1914, Twilight in the East system, modified to speed play, with care not to lose focus on those aspects of warfare that made the opening stages of WWI so unique. This game system, in conjunction with the accurate map, allows the German advance to be conducted along historical routes with the eminent \u201cOpen Flank\u201d present (instead of units strung out from map edge to map edge). The Allied player has an opportunity to recreate a \u201cMiracle of the Marne\u201d type victory or to stop the Germans earlier. Likewise, the German player has a chance to change history and defeat the Allies\u2019 armies in 1914.\n\nThe Grand Campaign scenario covers the period from the fall of Liege on August 16th to exhaustion at Ypres in mid-November. Two shorter scenarios, The Battle for Lorraine (a learning scenario) and From the Marne to Stalemate are also provided.\n\n1914, Offensive \u00e0 outrance is a playable \u201cMonster Game\u201d designed with the expressed goal that the majority of the game can be completed by four dedicated players in one five-day long Expo. The 24-page rules booklet is concise, well written and organized. The game is exciting and gives wonderful insights into one of the most important campaigns of the twentieth century.

Will you use the transit station to move another player\u2019s military base out of the way, or place your embassy to steal his temple? Will you try for a greater area under your control, or move to capture key buildings?\n\nInfinite City is a standalone tile game in which players become the leaders of corporations building an ever-sprawling city, maneuvering to control the largest districts while holding on to the most valuable buildings.\n\nInfinite City uses tiles to represent buildings, and colored pegs to represent control by players.  The tiles are mixed, five tiles are dealt to each player, and five tiles are placed face down in the shape of a cross at the center of the play area.  On their turns, players play a tile face up adjacent to one of the five starting tiles or a previously played tile, play one of their colored pegs on the tile, and follow the instructions on the tile.  These instructions may lead to playing additional tiles, drawing tiles, moving tiles previously played, turning face down tiles face up, taking tiles from opponents, preventing actions or even exchanging hands of tiles with other players.  When players finish their turns, if they have less than five tiles in their hands, they draw additional tiles so that they end their turn with at least five tiles.\n\nThe game ends when one player places the last of his colored pegs, or the fifth Power Station tile is played.  Each player is awarded points for contiguous groups of at least three tiles controlled by him at a rate of one point per tile.  Some tiles have a point value number in the corner; players receive the number of points indicated for such tiles that they control.  Also, some tiles have silver rings; the player controlling the most of these receives one point per such tile.\n\nThe player with the most points wins.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.891, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 5.96136, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Brent Keith"], "categories": ["City Building", "Science Fiction", "Territory Building"], "minage": 10, "name": "Infinite City", "playingtime": 45, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": 2088}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": 974}], "average": 6.23171, "usersrated": 1625, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 1.48385, "expands": [], "numcomments": 524}, "46810": {"mechanics": [], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic509637.jpg", "wishing": 3, "owned": 0, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 46810, "yearpublished": 1983, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic509637_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Ideal"], "families": ["Sports: Boxing", "Sports: Combat Sports / Martial Arts"], "description": "This Flip R'Cade series board game is based on the video game Rocky.

The track is made of spaces that are either white, red, or black. Players try to be the first to get to the end spot on the track, and movement is determined by the Elchomat.\n\nThe Elchomat is filled with five of the six pieces. The sixth is placed outside one of the four entrances. On a players turn, they push the outside piece into the Elchomat, and of course one of the pieces comes out the other side. The piece that emerges determines the car's movement. The arrow means the car moves one space. The numbers depend on the colors. With red numbers, the car moves forward if the car is on a red space. Otherwise, the car moves backwards. The same works for black. The car moves forward with any number if it starts on a white space. If the elk emerges, the car is struck by an Elk and loses a turn.\n\nA fun game to play, and it is very difficult to remember how the pieces are positioned within the Elchomat.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Max J.

It is designed for 3-6 players, but there is a 2-player variant, and the rules are such that someone who has played it can explain it quickly to new players.\n\nsoft landing is a trade and resource management game, but the trick is, different players are going to be trying to end the game different ways, and everyone has a different starting score. The European Union has good production numbers, but only starts with 3VP. Africa, not so good on production, starts with 12VP, and there are regions that start with up to 17VP. Obviously, Africa wants the game to end sooner, while it is still ahead, and may try to force Catastrophes. The EU wants the game to last longer so it can develop New Era tech, and will be trying to abate Catastrophes.\n\nYou need to provide for the needs of your people, and if you do not, you generate \"stress\", which accumulates in a central location. The type of stress depends on your nation.\n\nFor instance, on a production roll of \"5\", Africa generates one Tech, one Industry and one Resources. If it does not acquire some Reserves or Lifestyle by the end of the turn, it will generate (from left to right, Political stress, Health stress and Population stress (fyi, the panda is Environmental stress). Each of these stresses has a little holding area on the score track where all the tokens accumulate until bad things happen...\n\nEach nation also can use its production to buy special abilities, which are generally what you use to mess with other players. For instance, Africa has good production numbers for \"Resources\" and might have a surplus, but need \"Industry\". Another player might have Market Manipulation, and use it to drive the \"sell\" price for Resources down to zero, screwing over Africa. Or, a nation with a Military could take existing stress tokens and rearrange them. When enough stress builds up, bad things happen (minor or major Catastrophes), and whoever has the most of their tokens in that zone takes the blame (and loses VP). Your Military is not actually attacking another player, you're just taking existing global stress and shifting it around to get yourself out of a jam, blame someone else, or both. Your turn consists of production, using abilities, trade, stress and investment, each of which is a very simple action, so turns move pretty quick.\n\nsoft landing has some superficial strategies and some more subtle ones.

The rope net also has 4 broken rope spaces which will drop a player's piece to the sea (out of game) if they land on it.\n\nPlayers have two options a turn, they may either launch as many as up to 5 game pieces from their ship's cannon doors towards the enemy. Or, move all their pieces on the net forward one space, either forward or diagonally up/down. Player pieces that land on the opponent's pieces remove the enemy pieces from the game.\n\nIf a player's pieces reach the other ship, they will destroy the opponent's cannon door and any pieces behind it. The player's piece is also returned to the player's ship to again enter the net.\n\nThe optimal game end is when one player removes all the other player's pieces from the board.\n\nAn added complication is that pieces moving up or down off the net return on the opposite top or bottom, depending on movement.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Christopher Day"], "categories": ["Pirates"], "minage": 0, "name": "Piracy", "playingtime": 40, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 5.14286, "usersrated": 7, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 2.64189, "expands": [], "numcomments": 5}, "46962": {"mechanics": ["Memory"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic981466.png", "wishing": 0, "owned": 4, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 46962, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 8, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic981466_t.png", "publishers": ["Clown Games"], "families": ["Bingo"], "description": "Animalbingo with sound.

But they can only be built in the zero-gravity and high-vacuum conditions in space. Various private and government enterprises race to establish a buckytube mechanosynthesis factory on a suitable carbonaceous asteroid. To do so, they accumulate tanks of water in orbiting fuel depots, to be used as rocket propellant. Also needed are remote-controlled robonauts to do the grunt work.\n\nThe key to success is water in LEO (low Earth orbit). At first, water will be expensively supported out of the deep gravity well of Earth. But for a third the fuel and energy, water can be supplied from Luna, the moons of Mars, or other nearby hydrated objects.  Extracting resources at the work site is called In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU). Whoever develops ISRU technology able to glean water from space rather than Earth will gain the strategic high ground to make money through exoglobalization.\n\nIn High Frontier, players are Earth governments which are racing to put together a functioning space program to extract resources and colonize the other planets, moons, and asteroids in our solar system.

Everyone's always involved in the game, even when it's not their turn to move their playing piece!  The game is completely different every time you play!\n\nWarning:  If a board game needs to be all about strategy, setup, and \"the win\" in order for you to enjoy it, then you may want to avoid The Tower of Mystery because it's a rapidly changing game that's frequently outside of your complete control.\n\nBut if you enjoy a purely social game that's all about player interaction, fun, laughter, and \"the journey\", then chances are great that you'll love the Tower of Mystery!  Social gamers of all ages (adults, college students, teens) and Families enjoy the game!\n\nThe Tower of Mystery contains no occult elements, magic, spells, or evil characters.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDetailed Game Description\n The Tower of Mystery combines luck, unpredictability, and a dash of strategy make this an exciting, lively game for everyone. Because up to eight players can play, nobody is left out! It's competitive, interactive, rapidly changing, and fun!\n\nEveryone starts in the Garden outside the Tower. Travel around the tower's seven levels, take secret passages, and use staircases, in an attempt to visit each of the four turrets in the tower (in no particular order) and collect a turret token. Once you have all four turret tokens, and have collected Mystery Cards that spell the word \"TOWER\", declare your impending win to the other players and then head back to the Garden!  The first person to return to the Garden with Mystery Cards spelling \"TOWER\" and has a turret token from each of the four turrets, wins the game!\n\nWhen playing The Tower of Mystery, you win by constantly adjusting your game-play based on unexpected events.  No matter how masterful you think your plan for winning the game is, it WILL be up-ended by your opponents, and the crazy events that occur within the tower. Your goal is to keep moving towards achieving the game objectives as best you can!  During the game, players move around the seven levels, up and down staircases, and into the four turrets, landing on board spaces where \"things happen\". Sometimes a player may get money or lose money, get or lose Mystery Cards, may get to roll the dice and see what happens, might have the chance to swap the location of their playing piece with another player's piece, steal cards or money from other players, or any of many different scenarios and possibilities.\n\nIn addition to the \"TOWER\" Mystery Cards, there are Mystery Cards that allow you to do nice things to yourself, or try to stop your opponents.  There are several ways to collect Mystery Cards. Some ways are free, others cost money. The fastest but most risky way to collect free Mystery Cards is to stay in a turrent for multiple turns. However, while in a turret, a player is vulnerable because they cannot play any Mystery Cards. Players can collect up to 3 free Mystery Cards per turn while in a turret so even though it's risky to stay in a turret for very long, there's definitely a benefit to visiting the turrets even though playing Mystery Cards there is a no-no.\n\nPlayers can play any number of Mystery Cards on any other players (or themselves) even when it's not their turn! This can cause \"mayhem\" when several players suddenly jump into the action at the same time!  You will have to alter your plans over and over in order to stay ahead of your opponents!  Almost constant player interaction keeps everyone on their toes, all the while laughing and having fun every step of the way!\n\nAt the end of each turn that a player's piece is in a turret, they must draw a Turret Card. Turret Cards might affect only the player drawing the card, might affect everyone in the game, or several players but not all.  One thing is for sure: Turret Cards often dramatically change the game for everyone in an instant! Some Turret Cards are helpful, but most of them cause unexpected, often funny events to happen to some or all of the players in the game!\n\nWhile money is a component of the game, it has no bearing on winning the game! Tower Bucks are used to buy Mystery Cards and pay penalties. Being broke is risky, because if a player is completely broke and they have to pay a fine to the bank or a penalty to another player, they lose three turns!  Hoarding money serves no purpose, however, so each player has to decide how much money is enough to keep and how much is safe to spend.\n\nThe Tower of Mystery is a great Party Game for all ages! Adults young and old enjoy playing The Tower of Mystery when together for their regular social Game Night. Families enjoy it for Family Game Night because it's equally playable for both the kids and the parents.

Players must carefully allocate their resources as they seek to build their kingdom, complete quests, and attack the enemy\u2019s capital.\n\nSet in the rich and diverse Warhammer universe, player's can choose different factions that each have their own style. Will you play the indestructible grudge-bearing Dwarfs, the shrewd and manoeuvrable Empire, the savage and destructive Orcs, or the entropic and mutating forces of Chaos. Or will you cleverly craft an alliance, playing the combined might of the forces of either Order or Destruction?\n\nWarhammer: Invasion follows a similar model to that of Magic: The Gathering. Players will construct a deck of cards to their liking that they will use to battle against each other by drawing cards and using resources to play them. Cards can consist of monsters or heroes, one-off spells or abilities, and permanent structures, devices, or equipment. However, there are many differences which make W:I very different from Magic. Two of the main differences are in the release model and the ordering of the gameplay area.\n\nRather than a blind collecting model, W:I follows Fantasy Flight Games' LCG model. Each expansion or chapter pack is released with the full contents known to the purchaser. Rarity is not a factor.\n\nRather than playing your cards into the same area and relying on card draws for resources or extra cards, each player has a 3-zoneCapitol that they must protect and those sides are generally where cards are played. If an opponent causes enough damage to a section of your capitol it is \"burned.\" If two sides of your capitol are burned you lose. Depending on which side of your capitol you put a card into it will be able to different things. Units and buildings in the Kingdom Zone contribute to your available resource pool while ones in your Quest Zone cotribute to your card draws. Cards played into the Battlefield are used to attack opponents. Also, units in a zone being attacked by an opponent can be used to defend that zone from damage. This adds a large amount of tactical decisions when it comes to playing your cards. You must carefully balance building your economy with the ability to attack and defend.\n\nWarhammer Invasion LCG Core Set contains:\n\n* 1 Rulebook\n    * 220 Cards representing 4 factions\n    * 4 Capital Boards\n    * 35 Resource Tokens\n    * 60 Damage Tokens\n    * 4 Burning Tokens\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBattle Pack Expansion Cycles:\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n1) The Corruption Cycle:\n\n    The Skavenblight Threat\n    Path of the Zealot\n    Tooth and Claw\n    The Deathmaster's Dance\n    The Warpstone Chronicles\n    Arcane Fire\n\n\n2) The Enemy Cycle:\n\n    The Burning of Derricksburg\n    The Fall of Karak Grimaz\n    The Silent Forge\n    Redemption of a Mage\n    The Fourth Waystone\n    Bleeding Sun\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n3) The Morrslieb Cycle:\n\n    Omens of Ruin\n    The Chaos Moon\n    The Twin Tailed Comet\n    Signs in the Stars\n    The Eclipse of Hope\n    Fiery Dawn\n\n\n4) The Capital Cycle:\n\n    The Inevitable City\n    Realm of the Phoenix King\n    The Iron Rock\n    Karaz-a-Karak\n    City of Winter\n    The Imperial Throne\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n5) The Bloodquest Cycle:\n\n    Rising Dawn\n    Fragments of Power\n    The Accursed Dead\n    Vessel of the Winds\n    Portent of Doom\n    Shield of the Gods\n\n\n6) The Eternal War Cycle:\n\n    Days of Blood\n    Oaths of Vengeance\n    Battle for the Old World\n    Glory of Days Past\n    The Ruinous Hordes\n    Faith and Steel          \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n7) Deluxe Expansions:\n\n    Assault on Ulthuan\n    March of the Damned\n    Legends\n    Cataclysm\n    Hidden Kingdoms\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.7264, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 6.95981, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Eric M.

The islands were populated in the late 19th and early 20th century. Commercial sugar cane cultivation and fishing (mainly for consumption on the islands) are the main sources of income. In the early 20th century, a small freight train network was build on South Daitou Island (\u00e5\u008d\u0097\u00e5\u00a4\u00a7\u00e6\u009d\u00b1\u00e5\u00b3\u00b6) to get the sugar cane to the harbor.

Villagers can follow monks when they move. To rescue a villager, you have to bring him to the Moon Portal and take a special rescue action on that tile.\n\nVillagers come in families of 1, 2 or 3 members. When an entire family is rescued, you get the family's reward. Small families give small rewards (like an extra Qi, or an artifact that can move the other monks to your tile), large families give large rewards (like a sword that lets you turn one die to white during each exorcism, or an armor that cancels the ghosts' come-into-play effects).\n\nUnfortunately, some ghosts are able to kill villagers. Each time a villager gets killed, the players suffer the family's curse (which can go from annoying -like having a tao token removed from the game- to downright brutal -like having a extra Wu-Feng incarnation come into play-). Villagers also die if their tile is haunted.

But it had its lighter side, too. It involved many pleasant days spent watching actual matches - recording every single detail of the games so that Card Cricket would be as authentic as possible.\n\nEquipment:\ni) Two packs of cards as follows: \na) Bowling pack (110 cards)\nb) Batting pack (108 cards)\nii) A scoring pad which resembles an ordinary cricket score book\niii) A special die - 5 faces showing out and 1 face showing 'not out'.\niv) A chart showing by means of asterisks which batting shots can be played against the various types of balls that can be bowled\nv) A loose scoring sheet which serves as an example of how to score with instructions printed on the back.\n\nThis is a mechanically simple cricket simulation game. You are expected to 'know' cricket (but why else would you be playing it?), and thus how to arrange and score matches, etc. Each player plays one team (obviously if more than two people are playing the game, they can take the part of different players in the cricket match).\n\nThe mechanism is one of hand management. The bowler picks 6 random cards for the balls in the over, which he can play in any order. The batsman has a number of batting cards which varies according to which number he is batting at. The bowler plays a card (a ball) and the batsman plays a card against that ball. If the batting card is a valid stoke for that ball (a cover drive for a half volley outside off stump, a sweep to a googly, etc), then the outcome is as printed on the batting card sometimes runs, but often just fielded. If the batting card is not a valid stroke for the ball bowled, then the batsman is likely to be out (there are appeals and not outs using the die). If he is not out, the batsman replenishes his hand, and the next ball is bowled.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Graeme Levin", "Arnold Witkin"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Sports"], "minage": 0, "name": "Card Cricket", "playingtime": 120, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 6.5, "usersrated": 2, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.5, "expands": [], "numcomments": 1}, "51629": {"mechanics": ["Auction/Bidding", "Route/Network Building", "Stock Holding"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic528080.jpg", "wishing": 23, "owned": 2, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 51629, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 18, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic528080_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Games on the Brain"], "families": ["18xx"], "description": "18xx in 90 minutes?

It's the most realistic and excitingly detailed  simulation of the Canadian pro game that's ever been created!\n\nWith COLD SNAP, you can bring back \"the good old days\" of Canadian pro football, or, re-live last year's exciting pro season! ANY time is \"football season\" when you've got a copy of COLD SNAP on your game shelf! YOU call the plays, YOU set the defensive alignments, YOU decide who to bring in when a star player goes down with an injury. Think you can do a better job with your favorite Canadian pro team than the real-life coach did? Well, now you can find OUT! (HINT: you might just gain a new respect for the real-life coach!)\n\nRecent years have seen a glut of new football games hit the market. Many of them are very good. But two key differences make COLD SNAP Canadian Pro Football simulation board game stand out above the crowd of pro football simulation board games...\n\nFIRST, this is a pro football game where EVERY player on the field matters. In many other games, defenders and linemen are treated almost as an afterthought--some games don't even rate them at ALL! But in COLD SNAP, the success or failure of a play most often HINGES on the performance of these players! Yes, the star Canadian passers and runners will stand out on your table-top--but so will the star interior linemen, linebackers and defensive backs! It's exciting to watch!\n\nSECOND, the COLD SNAP results book is cleverly designed to tell you not only WHAT happens on every play, but also WHY! Other games might tell you, for example, that the quarterback just threw an incomplete pass--and that's all the information you get. However, the COLD SNAP results book will tell you whether the incompletion was the result of great coverage by a defensive back, a hurried throw thanks to a missed block by an offensive lineman, a wrong pass route run by the receiver, or any of a multitude of other possible reasons! You'll know what DID happen, AND what MIGHT have happened, if not for the play made or NOT made. It's just like watching pro football on TV, with the game book serving as your color commentator!\n\nCOLD SNAP Canadian Pro Football simulation board game is incredibly detailed, yet easy to play. The offense coach chooses a ball carrier or intended receiver for one of six basic offense plays, while the defense coach secretly decides on one of four basic color-coded defense settings. (You can play solitaire, too--there are rules included for that!) Roll the dice, look up the result in the game book, record the gain or loss, and move on to the next play! It's that simple!\n\n", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Keith Avallone"], "categories": ["Sports"], "minage": 0, "name": "Cold Snap Canadian Pro Football Simulation Board Game", "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 7.9375, "usersrated": 8, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 2.70921, "expands": [], "numcomments": 5}, "50279": {"mechanics": [], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic524807.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 50279, "yearpublished": 2004, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic524807_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"], "families": [], "description": "This amazing color learning game helps children to develop speech, concentration, color recognition, & observation skills, while having lots of fun!

The first player that plays their last domino from their hand, adds up the count remaining in their opponent's hand and scores the total divided by five (5) (IE: if the opponent had a count of fifteen (15) in their hand, the scorer would score three (3) points).\n\nFive-up is played to a score of 61, and is usually played with a Cribbage board to keep score.\n\nFive-up is unique in that every double domino played is a possible \"spinner,\" and plays can be played on all four sides of a \"spinner.\"\n\nThe rules for Five-Up were standardized and popularized in the 60's by Dominic C. Armanino, who wrote at least four books on Dominoes. He was a strong advocate and PR agent for this version of the game.

This is the original version of the game, which went through several iterations before ultimately appearing as a boxed game as Railway Rivals and Dampfross. It was designed by David Watts, a Welsh geography teacher and train buff.\n\nIt was always intended first and foremost to be a good game to play, but David also wanted to use it for general education \u2013 explaining why railway lines were laid where they were, etc. The game is fundamentally straightforward \u2013 players build railway lines on a map (a tesselation of hexagons) with towns, rivers, hills, coastlines, etc. After a building phase there is then a racing phase \u2013 players race between randomly generated combinations of towns. Players with the most extensive efficient networks tend to win more races, and thus the game.\n\nIt always existed as 'just' a set of rules, with a number of official or unofficial maps available from various sources. The earliest and crudest manifestation was just a few (5 or 6) A4 hexagon sheets, and colouring instructions to make the maps up. When postal games players showed considerable enthusiasm for the game, David moved on to produce large size (slightly bigger than A2) hexagon sheets, also with colouring instructions. Later on the maps were printed in one colour on big maps, which you could colour highlight yourself, and cover with sticky-back plastic sheets, so that maps could be reused if water-based pens were used that could be washed off. Multicolour maps followed, which were later printed with a laminate covering.\n\nThe railways cost more if you go over mountains etc, but this gives you shorter routes. You can run parallel to other lines at a cost, or simply link into another player's track and rent the tracks of other players when you race.\n\nThe mechanics are very simple, and there is some luck involved with the random races that appear, and in racing. Nevertheless, the better players nearly always come out on top. Despite the apparent simplicity, there are plenty of opportunities for thoughtful play, especially with tactics such as blocking other players out of areas of the map.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": ["Railway Rivals"], "designers": ["David G.

"description": "\"A party game for horrible people.\"\n\nPlay begins with a judge, known as the \"Card Czar\", choosing a black question or fill-in-the-blank card from the top of the deck and showing it to all players.  Each player holds a hand of ten white answer cards at the beginning of each round, and passes a card (sometimes two) to the Card Czar, face-down, representing their answer to the question on the card. The card czar determines which answer card(s) are funniest in the context of the question or fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent an \"Awesome Point\", and then the player to the left of the new Card Czar becomes the new Czar for the next round. Play continues until the players agree to stop, at which point the player with the most Awesome Points is the winner.\n\nThis, so far, sounds like the popular and fairly inoffensive Apples to Apples. While the games are similar, the sense of humor required is very different. The game encourages players to poke fun at practically every awkward or taboo subject including race, religion, gender, poverty, torture, alcoholism, drugs, sex (oh yes), abortion, child abuse, celebrities, and those everyday little annoyances like \"Expecting a burp and vomiting on the floor\".\n\nIn addition, there are a few extra rules.  First, some question cards are \"Pick 2\" or cards, which require each participant to submit two cards in sequence to complete their answer. Second, a gambling component also exists.  If a question is played which a player believes they have two possible winning answers for, they may bet an Awesome Point to play a single second answer.  If the player who gambled wins, they retain the wagered point, but if they lose, the player who contributed the winning answer takes both points.\n\nFrom the website:\n\n\"Cards Against Humanity is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike license - that means you can use and remix the game for free, but you can't sell it.

This new planet will be harsh, but if you have the skills to manage your resources, build a fleet, research alien life, and settle colonies, the world can be yours.\n\nAlien Frontiers is a game of resource management and planetary development for two to four players. During the game you will utilize orbital facilities and alien technology to build colony domes in strategic locations to control the newly discovered world.\n\nThe game board shows the planet, its moon, the stations in orbit around the planet, and the solar system\u2019s star. The dice you are given at the start of the game represent the space ships in your fleet. You will assign these ships to the orbital facilities in order to earn resources, expand your fleet, and colonize the planet.\n\nAs the game progresses, you will place your colony tokens on the planet to represent the amount of control you have over each territory. Those territories exert influence over specific orbital facilities and, if you control a territory, you are able to utilize that sway to your advantage.\n\nThe planet was once the home of an alien race and they left behind a wondrous artifact in orbit. Using your fleet to explore the artifact, you will discover amazing alien technologies that you can use to advance your cause.\n\nWinning the game will require careful consideration as you assign your fleet, integrate the alien technology and territory influences into your expansion plans, and block your opponents from building colonies of their own. Do you have what it takes to conquer an alien frontier?\n\nRoll and place your dice to gain advantages over your opponent and block them out of useful areas of the board.  Use Alien Tech cards to manipulate your dice rolls and territory bonuses to break the rules.  Steal resources, overtake territories, and do whatever it takes to get your colonies on the map first!

The components have been designed to provide you with a very realistic model of the real world to both electronically and graphically simulate strategic and tactical confrontation between world powers. \nElectronic land, sea and air forces can be deployed against each other in any combination and are totally dependent on supplies which are represented by energy units.The game board is a true-to-life model of the relationships between countries of the real world in the early 1980's.\n\nForty-three countries have been divided into eleven \"politectonic\" or geo-political zones. Each country has been weighted with a power base figure that reflects its capability to persuade other nations to conform to its wishes - by diplomatic coercion or by direct military force.\n\nThese figures are based on the formula created by Ray S. Cline, formerly Deputy Director of Intelligence for the C.I.A.\n\nPp = (C+E+M)x(S+W)\n\nPERCEIVED POWER = (Critical Mass (Population + Territory) + Economic Capability + Military Capability) x (Strategic Purpose + National Will).\n\nFuture shifts in world power and change in governments will - of course - make changes in these numeric weightings appropriate. Players can feel free to sustain realism by changing the numbers assigned to each country as life goes on.\n\nIf you play other war games such as those published by Avalon Hill and SPI, you will find that the computer cartridge interfaces very effectively with them. The onscreen combats will generate much more excitement and realism than the usual dice provided to resolve conflicts. Onscreen energy units can be programmed into the computer to reflect the relative strength between different forces. The differential between the onscreen energy units at the end of each battle can also be applied to the combat results tables that come with these games.\n\nConquest of the World is the first game of its kind, so be ready for many unusual features. Take the rules one step at a time and you will find it to be a fascinating game of endless challenge - which, once learned, is not at all difficult to explain to others.\n\n\nTHE OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME is to lead your Homeland to world domination through negotiations, conquests and alliances. Each successful conquest and alliance you make will strengthen your country's power base. The country with the strongest power base at the end of the game is the winner.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["Video Game Theme", "Wargame"], "minage": 8, "name": "Conquest of the World", "playingtime": 45, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}, {"friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "name": "wargames", "value": null}], "average": 4.5, "usersrated": 1, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 0}, "48759": {"mechanics": ["Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Variable Player Powers"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic516750.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 4, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 48759, "yearpublished": 2009, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 1, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic516750_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Web published)"], "families": ["Brick Wars"], "description": "Battle for Brikopolis, or BFB, is a miniatures skirmish game in which two or more players create miniature Super Heroes and battle to protect the city, while simultaneously destroying it.

It is widely played in Louisiana, particularly within the Cajun culture and on the off-shore oil platforms near the Louisiana Gulf Coast.\n\nBourre uses a standard 52-card deck. Players ante up and are dealt a five card hand. They may then \"fold\" or continue, swapping out up to all five cards (in some variants they will re-ante to play a hand). The rules are fairly straightforward:\n (from Wikipedia entry):\n   1. You must play to win. This goes beyond simply \"playing a higher card\"; if you know that no one else has any trumps, and it is your turn to lead, you must play trumps if you have them.\n   2. You must play on-suit if possible, even if your highest on-suit card will not beat the highest card in play. Even if a trump has been played on a non-trump lead, if you have a card of the suit led, you must play on that suit.\n   3. You must play a trump if you have no on-suit cards. You still must play to win; if the only trump played is a 3, you hold the 2 and the Ace of trumps but no cards of the lead suit, you must play the Ace of trumps.\n   4. If you have neither any cards of the lead suit nor any trumps, you may play any card. This is an off card, and is effectively lower than the 2 of the lead suit.\n\nAt the end of the round, the person with the most tricks, takes the pot. If there is a tie, the pot stays in for the next round. If one of the players who played a hand did not take any tricks at all, he is said to have \"bourreed\" and must match the pot as his ante for the next round.

Each player has his own set of Influence Tokens and faces both his opponents in the Intrigue Card game and the struggle for board domination. The rules changes involved are simple, but the tactical options and scope for treachery have multiplied. Of course, final victory still depends on the scores of the Secret Identities, which are not revealed until Game End.\n\n\"Now you're on your own...\" is the motto of this expansion, again developed by Peter Struijf and Melchior van Rijn and self-published by Geode Games.\n\nThe 3-player expansion to Krakow 1325 AD will make its debut in October 2009 at Spiel in Essen (Germany). There are two versions: a ziplocked English/Dutch version and a boxed German version (which also contains a complete set of Intrigues and rules in that language).\n\nPeter wisely decided not to rely on his own high-school education to create the German version. He was overwhelmed when he found Andreas Brandhorst, sci-fi author and translator of almost the entire Discworld (Scheibenwelt) series, willing to translate the texts of the Intrigue cards.
