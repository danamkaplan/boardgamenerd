Instead of lone survivors battling it out at the mall, it is an international scale, with players managing the global response to an unknown threat. The game includes a 17 x 22 map, a set of 18 cards with turn roles, victory conditions and player aids, and a sheet of 88 counters. The map is semi-abstract, using area-based movement between major world population centers, trade hubs or points of economic or political interest, connected by lines representing the difficulty of zombies shambling their way from one spot to another. So, the New York City-Washington DC route is minimal difficulty (1), while the Los Angeles-Honolulu link is maximum difficulty (4)&hellip; Even routes like the latter are possible, zombies being an inventive bunch, stumbling into shipping containers and so on. And all it takes is one zombie to invade a region...<br/><br/>There are a number of things that add to the excitement in Zombie War. A situation like a plague of zombies would generate many different military, civilian and business responses, both in a real-world and typical zombie fiction sense (think of the Umbrella Corporation in Resident Evil). In Zombie War, each player takes on the role of Government, Military, Corporate or Zombies. However, each player plays a different role each game turn, passing their role to the right after each round of play. The government wants to keep people calm and find a medical answer to the problem, the military wants to halt the spread by any means possible (preferably violent), the corporate player wants to isolate the zombies for experimentation (and profit) and the zombies just want to spread. The points a player gains through game actions accumulate regardless of which role they are playing on a turn, but your take on what the military should be doing about the threat may be different than the previous military player, and at cross purposes with the next military player. Each role gains points for different things, and has certain unique actions that affect the other roles. For instance, the government player can adjust the global &quot;threat level&quot;, which determines the severity of military response allowed, but the government player gets points for leaving the threat level as-is or lowering it (&quot;the problem is contained, the public is encouraged to remain calm...&quot;), which is not necessarily what the military player wants.<br/><br/>Zombie War is designed to be simple enough to appeal to the typical player of Eurogames and a 3-4 player game, but to have the heart of a genuine strategic game and be playable just as well in a 2-player mode.&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Greg Porter"], "categories": ["Science Fiction", "Zombies"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Zombie War", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 1.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 2}, "81964": {"mechanics": ["Area Movement", "Card Drafting", "Hand Management"], "usersrated": 1, "image": "", "wishing": 0, "owned": 6, "trading": 0, "id": 81964, "yearpublished": 2004, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "", "publishers": ["Fishtank"], "families": [], "description": "The Scenario Pack adds 6 new boards, 14 scenarios and Die Helfer (The Helper), a new character-class, to the Behind trading card game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Sebastian Jakob", "Michael Palm"], "categories": ["Horror"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Behind: Scenario Pack", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 6.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "90162": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 15, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic932923.jpg", "wishing": 3, "owned": 23, "trading": 1, "id": 90162, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 3, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic932923_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Carrom Company"], "families": [], "description": "From their site:<br/><br/>Shuffleboard doesn&rsquo;t have to be a fair-weather sport.

Besides a startcard and finishcard (showing the treasure in a cave), the cards show different situations you come across (e.g. a hungry lion, a wild river, a giant snake, friendly villagepeople). Each card also shows a negative number, STOP, or 1 or 2 dice to roll.<br/><br/>1. Tembisa, the treasure hunt<br/>A line is laid out of the playing cards. All cards, except for the start and endcard are placed facedown. A player rolls the die and moves his or her pawn accordingly. If the card where the pawn ends is not face upwards yet, do it now. In either case: this card shows a picture of what you met, together with a it's effect on your pawn: move it accordingly. (The number of places shown backwards, STOP or roll 1 or 2 extra dice.) The card where pawn ends up has no further effect for that players turn.<br/>When six uncovered cards are in a uninterrupted row, this region is deemed fully explored.

If the attacker wins he or she robs a die roll of cards from the top of the attacked farm. These must be used immediatly to enlarge his or her owns farm(s) or be discarded.<br/>A STOP card can also be used to protect one farm. When placed on top a farm of your own, that farm is protected against robbings. However, you cannot enlarge it anymore either.<br/>Players hold six cards in their hands, drawing 1 extra at the start of ones turn.

(The discardpile is reshuffled and becomes the new drawpile each time.) Then the values of the farms are added for each player, the player with the largest farm is the winner!

The remaining crewmen desperately try to save their lives by escaping from the derelict spaceship, but in the darkness the aliens are lurking...hungry for human flesh.<br/><br/>The game is played on a hexagon-based map that represents the spaceship. Each player is given a map sheet and a pencil. Map sheets must be of the same zone, and every zone has its specific name. Starting from the first player and continuing clockwise, every turn, each player must make a movement. To do so, the player must write on their map sheet the coordinates of the sector to which they are moving. Every time the players move to the gray (dangerous) sectors they have to draw a card; these cards make the players tell the others their position or lie about it, depending on the card. Every card is kept secret from other players.<br/><br/>The humans' objective is to save themselves using the escape hatches, while the aliens' objective is to hunt down the humans. Each player's identity and position is kept secret; you will need to interpret the movements and behaviors of the other players to learn who and where they really are.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.8154, "bayesaverage": 6.35291, "designers": ["Mario Porpora", "Pietro Righi Riva", "Luca Francesco Rossi", "Nicol\u00f2 Tedeschi"], "categories": ["Horror", "Party Game", "Science Fiction"], "name": "Angriff der Aliens aus dem All", "playingtime": 45, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "1073"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "210"}], "average": 6.89326, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.37421, "numcomments": 388}, "86265": {"mechanics": ["Area Movement"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic839511.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 2, "trading": 0, "id": 86265, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 7, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic839511_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Warp Spawn Games"], "families": [], "description": "Territory Acquisition board game.

Collect (2) enemychips and move back (3) or pay $2500.&quot;  Here's one from &quot;Connections&quot;: &quot;Your boss' spouse takes a liking to you at a company picnic.  Move up (2) or collect $500 and two friendchips.&quot;<br/><br/>Most turns you'll have to make a decision as to how to best balance your forward progress with your money, friends, and enemies.  Friend chips are awarded for various &quot;friendly&quot; events, and Enemy chips are earned for all the people you had to step on to raise yourself up.  Friendchips can be turned into $250 each if you can't otherwise make loan payments, or they can be used to move up one extra space.  Enemy chips can be bought off for $500, and you can't enter the CEO's office (and win the game) unless you have more friendchips than enemychips.  You also must enter the CEO's office by exact count, so it helps to have friendchips to adjust you movement as needed.<br/><br/>In addition, certain squares landed on indicate that a card from the &quot;Outside Influence&quot; deck is drawn.

In her quest to dominate the airwaves, Kim cheats on her husband, neglects her daughter, and mistreats her staff. It all seems worth it when she wins the biggest German Television Award, but sadly on the very same night she is crushed to death by debris falling from a Russian space station. At the gates of Heaven, she is informed that she has collected too much bad karma in her life, and has a long road of atonement ahead.

Once the H5N1 zombie virus spread and the zombie population dominated the living within Sunnyville, the zombies staged a revolt and took over the government. The Center for Disease Control, hearing of this epidemic centered in Sunnyville, quarantined the town and the U.S. Government threatened to 'wipe out' the population of zombies to prevent further spreading of this viral nightmare. But the citizens of the newly-formed Zombie Town weren't the stereotypical aggressive zombies portrayed in movies, television and comic books. The citizens of Zombie Town were simply dead and decomposing but still the same as before - upstanding citizens! But with one gruesome exception: the virus gave them an intense craving for living human flesh! Because a mandatory vaccine against the H5N1 zombie virus was given to the human population outside of Zombie Town and the epidemic ceased to exist, human rights activists caught wind of the situation in Sunnyville (aka: Zombie Town) and formed the Save a Zombie Alliance. Millions banded together across the country and persuaded the United States government to sign an unprecedented peace treaty with the zombies. Ashes, the self acclaimed Emperor of Zombie Town, represented the zombies and outlined the truce with the U.S. President. The major clause in the treaty was that zombies would not cross the borders of Zombie Town unless on an approved journey by the U.S. President and they would never hunt living humans for food outside of their borders. Because there were extensive warning signs posted for miles surrounding Zombie Town's borders, there was an addendum in favor of the zombies that if a living human ended up inside the borders of Zombie Town, they were 'fair game' to be hunted, captured and on a zombie's dinner table. Ashes set forth the laws of Zombie Town and the treaty was to be signed by both Ashes and the U.S. President within 24 hours. The citizens were happy to be at peace with the United States Government. Thankfully, they discovered they could sustain themselves by eating pumpkins but pumpkins didn&rsquo;t quite satisfy their appetite for living human flesh. Suppressing their cravings led to increasing irritability and with frustrations escalating in Zombie Town, Ashes knew s/he had to pump up the morale of the citizens. Leary of an impending civil unrest, s/he scheduled the Undead Festival which was a massive town-wide celebration with delicious pumpkin-inspired food, rockin' music and fun zombie games.

A player's turn consists of (1)drawing a card, (2)dueling another player's knight (optional), (3)turning in any pairs of cards you may have for more knights, and (4) moving any one knight to either an adjacent space or any available green space on the board, one of which allows a player to draw an extra card on their turn.<br/><br/>When a player starts a duel with another player, they each select a card from their hand, and higher card wins (king is high).  Ties are draws and both cards are discarded.  Re-dueling is optional. The winner draws a card from the draw pile AND takes both cards used in the duel (placed in 'pair's pile'), and loser removes their knight from the board.<br/><br/>Certain spaces on the board have numbers on them which require the attacker to play a card of that value or higher, while the defender may play any card value. Jokers may be played at any time to steal a random card from an opponent's hand.<br/><br/>After dueling, if you have any pairs (from either your hand or your 'pair's pile' ) you may turn as many as you wish in for more knights which are then placed in any space adjacent to another of your own knights.<br/><br/>Your goal is to have your knights occupying all four king spaces on the board.  You must always occupy at least one king space on the board, but not necessarily the one you started with.  If a person loses a duel for their last king space, all of their knights are removed from the board, and their cards are given to the winner of the duel.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": [], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Card Game"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Kings' Duel", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "86356": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 103, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic895845.jpg", "wishing": 67, "owned": 496, "trading": 8, "id": 86356, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 6, "wanting": 15, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic895845_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Pegasus Spiele", "Steve Jackson Games"], "families": ["Munchkin"], "description": "NOTE: Only those who own Munchkin games dated before April 2010 need to purchase this set.

Hitler blames his political opponents and enacts repressive laws.<br/>Mar. 5: The Nazi Party wins the Federal elections amid a climate of fear and intimidation. From this point on, with a precise and constant rhythm, Hitler dismantles all of the democratic institutions of the fragile Weimar Republic and inaugurates a reign of terror, gradually establishing a ruthless and violent dictatorial regime.<br/><br/>The above is history, but what would have happened if instead of bringing Europe into a maelstrom of war, the infamous Austrian corporal had abandoned his plan of global domination and taken the path of peace? Would World War II still have broken out? Or would the Nazi hierarchy and German industry still have pushed the F&uuml;hrer to war with Poland? What would the dream of a Greater Germany have been without Austria, Czechoslovakia, and the other German territorial claims? Would the Western plutocrats or the Soviet colossus have fought the fascist dictatorship anyway and nevertheless inexorably triggered global conflict?<br/><br/>Democracy under Siege is an interactive simulation enabling you to explore all such questions. A card-driven strategy game, it reproduces the geopolitical conflicts and political struggles that led to the Second World War. The game covers the period 1933-1940 and is designed for two or three players. Each takes the role of one of the three ideologies &mdash; Democracy, Nazism and Communism &mdash; that struggled for power during the timeline of the game. (When played by two players, the two Ideologies exclusively under player control are Democracy and Nazism, while control of Communism alternates between the two players from turn to turn according to specific rules.)<br/><br/>Each game turn represents one year and is divided into three or four rounds. Players choose one political action and one event per round and attempt to perform the political action by rolling a die and applying some modifiers. They can affect the outcomes of their attempts by expending the ideology's political prestige. Events are activated immediately before the political actions are attempted; no die roll is required. If the political action succeeds, the card effects are applied accordingly. In any case, even when the attempt is unsuccessful, the political action cards played provide a varying number of political points (PP) that can later be expended by the players to perform activities.<br/><br/>After political actions, players perform their action round with the PP provided by political action cards. Players can influence the political allegiance of minor countries, exploit the economic resources belonging either to minor nations or to their controlled powers, recruit and activate coup cells to attempt coups d'etat to overthrow a minor country regime, send military forces to local conflicts or intervene in a civil war in a minor nation. All of these activities, as well as the effects of successful political actions, can bring victory points (VP) when the political allegiances of minor countries come under the influence or the control of Ideologies, or when territories or nations are conquered.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, players check the outcomes of coup attempts, then proceed to a new round. During the clean-up phase at the end of each turn, players perform end-turn checks and calculate the production of military resources (MR) by the exploitation of economic resources claimed on the map. MR are put in the ideologies' force pool and expended to maintain the minor nations allegiances. The remaining MR provide additional VP and can be employed during the subsequent turns to intervene in local conflicts and civil wars.<br/><br/>Democracy under Siege offers an accurate and detailed historical context, supported by 108 strategy cards. Players exploit historical events and political actions to achieve political supremacy. Wars are simulated by an abstract combat system that allows players to intervene and influence their outcomes. The main concepts reproduced in the game are the ideological struggles among the major powers, the race for armaments ahead of World War II and the buildup of a network of diplomatic links with minor nations. All of these elements combine to determine victory.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.5, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Luca Cammisa"], "categories": ["Political", "Print & Play", "Wargame", "World War II"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Democracy under Siege", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 180, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.6875, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.88642, "numcomments": 25}, "86473": {"mechanics": ["Betting/Wagering", "Dice Rolling"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic842441.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "trading": 0, "id": 86473, "yearpublished": 1976, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic842441_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Onsworld"], "families": ["Onsworld Jackpot Dice"], "description": "This is a dice game in Onsworld's Jackpot Dice series.<br/>The game comes with five special dice that show an Ace, deuce, four, eight ten and Jack.

It took him six days to complete his work, assisted by a host of heavenly angels doing his divine bidding. On the seventh day God rested and examined the result. Seeing that it was good, he praised the angel who had contributed the most.<br/><br/>Genesis - In the Beginning gives you the chance to become that angel. By gathering the essence of creation - chaos, matter and life - and turning it into seas and mountains, birds and beasts, you hope to win Gods approval - and the game! But the way to victory is wrought with hard decisions. You must gather essence when it's most advantageous, move at the right time and do your days&rsquo; work where they count the most. And beware of the dark angel who's trying to outshine you all.<br/><br/>Now - let there be light!<br/><br/><br/>Contents<br/><br/>1 game board<br/>1 God<br/>1 dark angel<br/>6 player angels<br/>42 day work markers<br/>1 starting player marker<br/>72 essence cubes<br/>1 rules booklet<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Before the creation, the players&rsquo; angels are gathered in the void with God. When God starts the creation with the words &quot;let there be light&quot;, the angels start their monumental task. There&rsquo;s a lot do to and only seven days to get it done in, so every action counts. Throughout the game, God moves over each of the seven days on the game board, stopping morning, midday and evening, allowing the players 21 rounds to act. During their turn, players can choose to collect the essence of creation (chaos, matter and life), to do a day work on the current day using the different kinds of essence they have collected, or to follow in God&rsquo;s path to another day.<br/><br/>When players move from day to day, they&rsquo;re positioned along the essence track. The essence track determines both the order of play and the type of essence a player can gather. The first player to move to a certain day gets the first position, the second player the second position, and so on. As different positions yield different kinds of essence, the players must plan their movement to get the right kind and the right amount of essence. If they&rsquo;re not happy with their position, they can spend essence to swap positions with a neighboring angel, thereby also thwarting other players&rsquo; plans.<br/><br/>When God creates a new day with new tasks for the angels, players can move to that day. The first player to do a day work on a certain day is awarded the highest points, the second player the second highest, and so on. As the week progresses, the points earned for doing a day work increase, which affects players&rsquo; long-term strategy.<br/><br/>As the seventh day is a day of rest, God looks favorably on angels that retire from their hard work. The first player to retire their angel on the seventh day earns the highest points, the second player the second highest, and so on. When God reaches the evening of the seventh day, the game is over. All points will be tallied and the player with the highest score is declared the winner.<br/><br/>To make things even more challenging, a dark angel is mixed in with the players&rsquo; angels, doing his best to snatch as many points as possible. The dark angel follows a pre-determined pattern of actions that the players can predict and delay but never stop. If the players aren&rsquo;t careful, or if they&rsquo;re too caught up in their own plans, the dark angel will surely outshine them, making all of them lose the game.<br/><br/>The mechanics of the game are quite simple: the sooner you do a day work on a day, the higher the points you score, making it a good idea to keep close in God&rsquo;s wake. Unfortunately, simply following God throughout the creation might not give you the exact essence you need to do your day work. Eventually you must stop to collect essence, preferably in the right position, making you lose momentum. In the end it&rsquo;s always about choices: when and what to collect, when to move and when to do a day work. The winner, God willing, is the player who makes the right choices at the right time, a task easier said than done.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.4091, "bayesaverage": 5.56588, "designers": ["Peter Hansson"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Mythology", "Religious"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Genesis", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "6870"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "468"}], "average": 5.80913, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.53156, "numcomments": 105}, "86496": {"mechanics": ["Card Drafting"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic842299.jpg", "wishing": 7, "owned": 5, "trading": 0, "id": 86496, "yearpublished": 2011, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic842299_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Web published)"], "families": [], "description": "2012: The Day of Fallout - Commander<br/>Free, tactical board game for 2 players (print and play)<br/><br/>Lead one of two armies: Human Section 8 and Arkanian alien race.

Each card holder is then placed window-side up on the game board, in the matching-color rectangle. Each player selects a token, places it on the 'Start' space on the game board, and rolls the dice to determine who plays first (highest roller, play continues clockwise).<br/><br/>Ona player's turn, that player rolls the dice and moves his token that number of spaces in any direction (backtracking in the same turn is not allowed). If the player lands on a colored, lettered space, the player must open the corresponding window (by letter) on the corresponding card holder (by color). If a player lands on one of the four outside corner spaces, <b>all</b> the windows on the corresponding card holder (by color) may be opened. When a player lands on a pink &quot;Face ID&quot; space, the player selects <b>any</b> card holder and opens all unopened windows.

To identify the person, the player must state the name of the person on the card--<b>not</b> the name of any character the person has played. (Example: &quot;Bob Keeshan&quot; would be correct, but not &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;.)<br/><br/>All players determine whether the player is correct. If there is a dispute, the Master List is consulted by revealing the identification number at the bottom of the card. The player making the identification consults the list in secret. If he is correct, the card is removed from the holder and rewarded to the player, who closes the windows and places another card in the holder. That player rolls the dice and moves again.<br/><br/>If the player is incorrect, he places the card holder back on the board (leaving the windows open or closed, as they were). He does not reveal the correct identity of the person on the card, but he may not (of course) make another guess on the same card.<br/><br/>An incorrect guess, or no guess, ends a player's turn.<br/><br/>After a player has collected two cards of each color, he must land on a FACE ID space to attempt a Final Face Identification. When he lands on a FACE ID space, the player must attempt to identify the face in the corresponding (by color) card holder. The player consults the back of his collected face cards, which contain assorted letters. Those letters determine which if any of the unopened windows on the card holder he may open before attempting to identify the person.<br/><br/>If the player is incorrect on the Final Face Identification, his turn is over and play resumes as normal.

The British and Colonial troops seemed only too happy to oblige and, when enough losses had been inflicted to satisfy utu ('revenge' or 'payment'), the Maoris simply evacuated their trenches and rifle-pits.

Never fear- there is of course no bookkeeping. At the start of each turn players figure out how much &quot;change&quot; they gather to fuel their activities for the turn. Simply marching off into arid and barren territory, even if it is strategically important, will leave you high and dry and out of supply- forcing a humiliating retreat. Players must plan carefully where they are going, how long they will be there, and what can go wrong; losing a battle will deplete your treasury as well as your army.<br/><br/>The opposing armies are different too, adding another element to strategy. The Franks have excellent cavalry and good foot troops, but not many skirmishers. The Greeks have an abundance of archers and ambushers as well as hard fighting regulars, and a corps of Turkish mercenaries (of dubious loyalty..). Both sides have to pick their battlefields and their timing must be near-perfect to pull off a game-winning battle.<br/><br/>The terrain is not the friendliest; each players base is green and lush, but you can't win by sitting still. Feint and counter-feint will be the order of the day, but when the time comes, you must strike. Sieges can be long, but sudden assaults costly. Greeks can set up ambushes while the Franks can attempt impetuous charges- either one can, if handled properly, bring about your opponent's overthrow.<br/><br/>This is the kind of game where there can be no wasted moves; everything is important, and dilly-dallying will hurt you sooner rather than later. This is a game that will lead to taut nerves and a lot of beard stroking!<br/><br/>Does it take long to play?<br/>That's entirely up to you.

People cards are valued from 1 to 10 based on the amount of shame that person would have towards you should you be revealed as the culprit. Grannies are merciless...<br/><br/>Each player receives a hand of five odor cards, ranging in value from 0 to 7, with one 7, two 6s and so on to eight 0s. Going once around the table, each player in turn asks his neighbor, &quot;So how about it? Are you the one contributing to climate change? Are you the one making more methane?&quot; And so on. That neighbor can either fess up &ndash; in which case he scores all the people cards in play &ndash; or he can deny the charge, in which case the active player randomly draws a card from his hand and lays it on the table in front of the neighbor, revealing some of the smell that others have detected.<br/><br/>If you make it once around the table without anyone confessing, add another person card to the crowd of sniffers, then go around the table again. Repeat this process up to three times, at which point most people will have three cards in front of them. Everyone then simultaneously points to the person who they think created the ruckus (that is, who has the largest total of odor cards), abstaining if they are that person. Everyone then sums their stink, with the &quot;winner&quot; claiming the person cards in play and a card for each person blaming him; anyone who accuses a player incorrectly is penalized. Smallest score after a number of rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>Being dealt a hand of high numbers doesn't automatically presage your coronation as a gas god as high numbers typically have a special power that comes into play when someone reveals the card from your hand. The 7, for example, removes all other cards in your hand from play, while the 6 lets you exchange up to three cards from your hand with an opponent.

Movement, in this game, is only from quadrant to quadrant, each quadrant consisting of 6 points (1 thru 6, 7 thru 12, 13 thru 18, 19 thru 24).  The second piece on the wall has special ability of jumping over any wall that might be in the way to land in the next quadrant (hense the name &quot;Grasshopper&quot;).  Walls can only be built by moving a piece from the previous quadrant that is exactly 6 points away to a point that has one piece on it.  Once the players get their pieces to the 4th quadrant, they must build walls on the quadrant.  These walls (two piece stacks) can be borne off the board as a unit for the players turn.  The winner is the first player to bear off two walls consecutively, but not necessarily in two consecutive turns.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Matt Crispin"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Grasshopper", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.5, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.5, "numcomments": 1}, "86778": {"mechanics": ["Acting"], "usersrated": 4, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1774358.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 2, "trading": 0, "id": 86778, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1774358_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Patch Products"], "families": [], "description": "In 100 Really Dumb Things YOU have to DO while PLAYING this game, players will do some ridiculous things while laughing uncontrollably at each other.

Played solo or between two players with roles of questioner (later on just Q) and interpreter (N). The interpreter leads the game and the questioner is the one receiving information about his/her home, work, personality, love, future and past.<br/><br/>Game-play - The game-play is divided into two phases 1) the card turning and 2) the pendulum swinging.<br/><br/>1) The card turning phase starts by picking up the proper coloured scarabs to the game board; the hair, eyes and favourite colour of the Q. The Q shuffles the purple 54 card deck and hands it over to N. N divides the deck into 3 separate decks of 18, 9 and 27 cards. The cards are dealt on the game board in the order 18, 27 and 9. The 18 cards are dealt on locations shown at the front page of the rule leaflet. The cards have 6 words in them and one of those is picked depending which is forming a pyramid with the game board (the black half of the pyramid on the left side of the card and the white half of the pyramid on the game board). While the cards are dealt, the N questions the Q if the word on the cards have any special meaning. The forming words are related to either home (1st vertical row), work (2nd), personality (3rd), love (4th), future (5th) or past (6th), depending which vertical row the cards are placed to. The 27 cards are then dealt on the game board (some restrictions apply, see the rule leaflet). Then the deck of 9 cards is used as a key to whole interpretation. At last the rest cards of the deck of 27 are used to check if something is being dominant on some areas of the Q's life. The final interpretations varies each playing time.<br/><br/>2) The pendulum swinging phase starts by placing the four decks of 28 cards onto the game board. The decks are placed on lower part of the game board, around the pyramid (letter A shown on the first page of the rule leaflet). The decks represents the areas of home, work, personality and love. The players decide one of the four categories and Q decides a question he/she wants to get answered related to that category. The transparent pyramid is placed on the game board and the pendulum is used for random number selection. There is numbers of 1-28 around the pyramid on the game board and the random pendulum swing decides the number of the chosen card. The N reads the text on the proper card to the Q. Same is repeated to other categories and questions.<br/><br/>Goal of the game - Interpreting the message gotten with cards and pendulum and gaining more self-consciousness.<br/><br/>The game includes:<br/><br/>1 game board<br/>1 transparent pyramid<br/>1 pendulum<br/>4 decks of cards (28 cards each)<br/>1 purple deck of cards (54 cards)<br/>2 bags including different coloured scarab buttons<br/>1 rule leaflet (4 pages)<br/><br/>From Finnish intro on the rule leaflet:<br/><br/>&quot;Karnak on kiehtovan j&auml;nnitt&auml;v&auml; ennustuspeli, jota voi pelata yksin tai yhdess&auml;.

Cathala suggested a few changes, then the pair worked together to bring the game to the table.<br/><br/>In Witty Pong the ping-pong table is recreated by laying four cards in a 2x2 square, with a ball token being placed on one of the cards. On a turn, a player flips a card and places it on one of the three cards not covered by the ball. Two situations can occur:<br/><br/>&bull; If the card depicts a ball somewhere in the artwork, the player must move the ball token to a new card. If he says anything or hesitates too long, he loses one of the three banana tokens with which he started the game.<br/><br/>&bull; If the card doesn't have a ball on it, the player must say the &quot;proper&quot; word, with the word being determined by the letters and colors on the three uncovered cards. The word starts with &quot;P&quot; or &quot;T&quot; depending on which letter shows more frequently, and ends with &quot;ong&quot; or &quot;ing&quot; depending on whether more blue or red paddles are showing. If he says the wrong word or takes too long, he loses a banana.<br/><br/>Lose all your bananas, and you're out of the game. Last moneky standing wins. The game includes advanced rules that change what to say if the same letter or color is on all three paddles; additional rules allow for competitive play in which players can steal bananas from one another if they say the right word first.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Antoine Bauza", "Bruno Cathala"], "categories": ["Sports"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Witty Pong", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 10, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 5.58, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.95284, "numcomments": 4}, "86840": {"mechanics": ["Point to Point Movement"], "usersrated": 2, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic848269.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 4, "trading": 0, "id": 86840, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic848269_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Unpublished)"], "families": [], "description": "Zip! is a tactical boardgame for 2 to 4 players, in which each player is searching for a buried treasure and, once found, tries to get away with the loot.<br/>Who finds a treasure, has a bigger chance to win, but has to be extra careful too, because each player can &quot;zip&quot; his/her stone around the board to hit an opponent's stone in a flash, removing the opponent from play and stealing his/her treasure on top of that.<br/>All stones are being moved simultaneously (players can hit the stone of an opponent in another players' turn) and for expert players there's a variation in which all player's stones are invisible!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Olaf Pieters"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Zip!", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.5, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.5, "numcomments": 1}, "86841": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic848406.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 2, "trading": 0, "id": 86841, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic848406_t.jpg", "publishers": ["HiKu Spiele"], "families": ["Animals: Sheep", "Animals: Wolves", "Mini-Lederspiele (Leather mini-games)"], "description": "The lush green grass of irish meadows and a homey shelter provide a pleasurable life for black sheep as well as white ones.

They do no know the value of the present they took.Via stairs and rooms of 3 different colors they attempt to bring them to the deck, to secure them. To do so, they throw a dice with the 3 different colors on it. A player must stop in a room of that color. When 2 players are in the same room, they have to switch presents. Two special actions which are in some rooms give players the chance to look at another players present, or his own, or to catch up with another player who is at max two stories higher in the ship. If all presents are on the deck, the player with the highest value of presents wins the game!<br/><br/>In The Giftgame players buy a few small presents upfront. They agree on the amount of money to be spent. You can also use the chips in the game and play for points.In this game also the colordice is used to decide to what field on the gameboard the player moves his playingfigure to. On each field is a different symbol, each giving a different action. The possible actions are: Take a present, switch presents and open them up, give present away to the player with the fewest presents, all presents in front of the players are passed to your neighbour in a clockwise fasion. and finally open up a present. When there are no more presents in the pile, the game ends. When playing with chips in stead of real presents, the game ends as soon as the last chip is taken from the supply. The player with the most points wins!~<br/><br/>The Memoryvariant is just another memory: There are 2 pairs of 12 different colored-and-valued chips. Turn them up-side-down so the sack is showing, shuffle them, and try to find the matching pairs as in regular memory.

The other group will consist of humans, plus humans with functions like workmen, fire fighters, police, nat'l guard, and some super-humans like Lara Croft and ninjas might appear during gameplay.<br/><br/>The game is driven foremost by the HO scale minis used in the game, and the plastic monsters. The toy value is what this &Uuml;ber-Ameritrash game is about.There will be multiple rule sets developed. Really, this game started with the toys, and a desire to improve an old game or two, while thematically morphing it into a game which featured downtown Milwaukee, WI USA.<br/><br/>At this point it's a prototype. The game is a homage to The Creature That Ate Sheboygan, borrows from Heorscape and Monsters Menace America, requires some D&amp;D features like THACO, and has lots of other options for tweaks and alt games.<br/><br/>The &quot;ha ha&quot; is deliberate in the name because of the twisted humor woven into the fabric of the game. The &quot;bronze fonz&quot; is on the map, and either side will get a bonus for either destroying it or simply rubbing it for good luck. Names for the creatures also have built-in humor:<br/><br/>Vince Gill: the bluegill who is also a Packer fan, but hates Milwaukeeans because of their fascination with the Friday Fish Fry. His desire is to crush restaurants which serve fish.<br/><br/>Son of Samson: the undead giant son of the most famous ex-resident of the Milwaukee Zoo, whose goal is to get to the top  of the Firstar/U.S. Bank tower and fling poo.<br/><br/>Carpie Diem: an asian carp, who seized headlines recently as the no.1 environmental enemy to Lake Michigan. He can jump across city blocks and smash things under his weight. Very easily distracted by the Ladybug Club, thinking they are asian lady beetles.<br/><br/>Holey Cow: a sympathizer with O'Leary's Chicago firestarter, this copycow is a Cubs fan and happens to breathe methane gas fires from her four stomachs, and out her nostrils. She's also capable of making massive cowpies which block city streets.<br/><br/>'Hood Ratz: a pair of residents from our failed Deep Tunnel system, these rodents are skaven mad *wink* and capable of chewing through even the five foot thick walls of the Fed Bldg. They're also attracted to hip-hop music.<br/><br/>Rebecca the Boiling Crayfish: (no relation to our new Lt. Governor of WI) she's looking for her crawdaddy in one of the restaurants that serve her brethren. The humans are in hot water this time.<br/><br/>The game narrative is such that an event has taken place that, combined with the deep tunnel sewer failure, has caused six local creatures to grow in size and terrorize Brewtown.<br/><br/>The Federal Bldg. is within the now quarantined section of Brewtown, and the goals of the monsters are many, but they have to achieve them before they are killed or the feds are able to call in the antidote. Meanwhile, the humans are to stay alive and kill monsters,while protecting buildings from fires, repairing blocked roads, and achieving other goals along the way.<br/><br/>There are several groups of humans:<br/><br/>Firefighters: complete with a new ladder truck, these six individuals have axes and hoses in hand *wink* to face any challenge.<br/><br/>Police: one car (Milwaukee police are grossly underfunded) and a handful of officers help with attacks, rescue civilians, and keep the peace among the surviving humans.<br/><br/>National Guard: these weekend warriors with five tanks were setting up for maneuvers downtown, ending in at the Veterans Memorial nearby when this hit. They've not got much live ammo with them for this reason, but they have plenty of rubber bullets of all sizes-and they look scary as hell. The can fly in one helicopter from General Mitchell Airport in a couple of rounds, and it will have the firepower they need, but the rest of the military is on furlough.<br/><br/>Municipal Construction: several men on a job site with a huge dump truck, a CAT backhoe, and two CAT scoopshovels. They're tough enough to fight the monsters on their own with their equipment and they're experts at &quot;catcalls&quot;.<br/><br/>Waste Management: one unmanned truck full of Milwaukee's finest refuse, abandoned.<br/><br/>Superhumans: activated at different times in the game when humans accomplish certain goals: a Lara Croft lookalike, with the guns to prove it; a ninja; two advanced swordplay students from the T'ai Chi Ch'uan center of Milwakee, and their leader Mike. Mike's wearing a Yoda costume he found at the Milwaukee Film office, and his mastery of push hands gives him the equivalent of the &quot;force push&quot;.

The game particularly focuses on the fighting of the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division in the Jolan District in the north-west part of the city in the morning of November 9th.<br/><br/>The player controls USMC troops while the system handles the insurgents. This design is based mainly on the article &quot;Infantry Squad Tactics: Some of the lessons learned during MOUT (military operations in urbanized terrain) in the battle for Fallujah&quot;, published in the September 2005 issue  of the Marine Corps Gazette.<br/><br/>The map includes a part of the Jolan District, divided into 61 zones of approximately 50x50 meters and sections of road of equal size. Each zone is made-up of several locations (open ground, courtyard, first storey, second storey, rooftop) represented by boxes that are used to manage movement. Tracks and charts are also on the map edges.<br/><br/>The troops of each side are represented by &lsquo;unit&rsquo; counters, each corresponding to one Marine squad (six to 12 men) or a group of insurgents (about six men each). The total strength of USMC forces is about that of a reinforced company. Each squad has a combat factor that is used to resolve firing and assaults. The attachment of a Combined Anti-Armor Team (CAAT) to a squad increases its combat factor in certain cases. When a USMC squad suffers a step loss during combat, the counter is flipped to its reduced side. If it suffers another loss, the unit is removed from the game (i.e., the squad is no longer operational and the wounded are evacuated to the rear). Insurgent units appear in two distinct types: guerrilla units and martyr units, also each with their own combat factors. Guerrilla units fight USMC troops but withdraw rather than be destroyed. Martyr units, instead, have vowed to die where they stand and kill as many enemies as possible. These units are immobile and, within their fortified positions, await the attacks of USMC forces. At all times, insurgent units are eliminated after suffering one step loss.<br/><br/>Insurgent units do not appear directly on the map. Initially, the player deploys &ldquo;suspect&rdquo; markers which represent a potential, non-identified danger to USMC troops. Their placement is partially random. Once fired upon or assaulted, these &ldquo;suspect&rdquo; markers are activated and their true nature (dummy, guerrilla, martyr, IED, or sniper) is revealed. However, USMC troops can also count on the support and fire power of a pair of M1A2 Abrams tanks. A section of Iraqi soldiers from the Iraqi Intervention Force (IIF) is also available, their mission being the capture of the mosque in Jolan, as the USMC troops do not have the right to enter that zone.<br/><br/>The game lasts a maximum of 16 turns, each representing about 15 minutes of real time. Each turn begins with a variable cycle of USMC support missions. These missions are of three types (reconnaissance by drones &ndash; UAV, close air support by helicopter, and aerial bombardment). Each of these missions can only be conducted a certain amount of times per game, and their execution is not automatic. In case of a mission being cancelled or delayed, the insurgents can temporarily take the initiative and act (reinforcements, withdrawal, counter-attack, etc.). Then, a reinforcement phase allows the player to enter extra troops onto the map at the cost of victory points. Each squad then has the opportunity to fire or move. After conducting movement, the player resolves his assaults against insurgent units that are adjacent to his Marines. Before launching an assault, a squad can detach its security element in order to isolate the zone and prevent any retreat by the enemy. There are three types of assaults in the game, depending on the locations occupied by the belligerents: &lsquo;top-down&rsquo;, &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo;, and normal. Each type has their advantages and disadvantages for the attacker and defender. CAAT support can also use their incendiary explosives to eliminate insurgents that are too strongly entrenched. Also, each assault can be accompanied by a random event which will influence its result. The game turn concludes with a re-organization phase during which the USMC capture of zones and the infiltration by insurgent troops is checked.<br/><br/>At the end of the 16 turns, the player determines his victory level. If all of the zones on the map are not controlled by the USMC, the player loses the game. If at the end of any turn the USMC controls every zone, the player wins the game and calculates his victory points to determine the extent of his victory (major, minor, bitter). A full game can be completed in about four hours.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>&bull; 17x22 map<br/><br/>&bull; 88 &frac12;&rsquo;&rsquo; die-cut counters and 140 5/8&rsquo;&rsquo; counters<br/><br/>&bull;  1 player aid<br/><br/>&bull; 1 die<br/><br/>&bull; Rule booklet<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 2.9474, "bayesaverage": 5.6935, "designers": ["Laurent Closier"], "categories": ["Modern Warfare", "Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Phantom Fury", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 240, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "3886"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "589"}], "average": 7.4555, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.952284, "numcomments": 63}, "86166": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 12, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic837880.jpg", "wishing": 8, "owned": 11, "trading": 0, "id": 86166, "yearpublished": 2009, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 3, "wanting": 5, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic837880_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Saien"], "families": [], "description": "Mangrove is a dexterity game for 2&ndash;4 players.<br/><br/>The game consists of 29 wooden sticks of variable thicknesses, and an elastic plastic middle part.

McClellan has formed and trained a large army, transported it by sea in an outflanking maneuver, marched it to the gates of the Confederate capital, and is poised to capture the city and probably bring an end to the rebellion.  On the Confederate side Lee has taken over the Army after Johnston was wounded.  Unlike Johnston, who was content to fight a largely defensive campaign, Lee gathered every unit he could get his hands on and launched his own offensive.  The Union had placed its army in an awkward position, with one corps north of Chickahominy River and the rest south of it.  Lee&rsquo;s plan, and the position of the units when the game starts, was to crush the Union Corps and then drive the rest of McClellan&rsquo;s army from the capital, destroying as much of it as he possible could.  With that accomplished he would have a free hand to turn north.<br/><br/>The system is a simplified version of two games, the last area-impulse Avalon Hill published, Breakout: Normandy, and MMP's Monty's Gamble: Market Garden.<br/><br/>The game features leaders who are rated for initiative and combat effectiveness.

The system of game immerses us therefore in an epic history, where nobles and necromantics hit in battles that re-draw the scene, and where conspiracies and disputes between races and clans modify the balances between the good and evil constant.<br/>In each of the events, the players leading the Heroes of Armarath they will try of affecting the destiny of the kingdom acquiring skills, followers and equipments that improve his inventory. The goal of the game is to defeat the enemy who waits in the catacombs of the Armarath, a hard quest that demands a powerful hero.<br/>The game is based on the Runebound play-system, but improves many aspects, like the amount of quest-cards (230), object cards (130) and game board (a detailed map of the kingdom of Armarath).<br/><br/>Website: armarath.blogspot.com<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": [], "categories": ["Adventure", "Fantasy"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Heroes de Armarath", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 180, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 1}, "91017": {"mechanics": ["Acting", "Memory", "Partnerships"], "usersrated": 11, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic908749.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 27, "trading": 0, "id": 91017, "yearpublished": 2009, "maxplayers": 12, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic908749_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Asmodee", "Repos Production"], "families": ["Time's Up!"], "description": "Time's Up!

Set to this background the players represent members of the royal family and try to locate good sites for new oil wells, find and deliver the different oil qualities and ship them to their base camps.<br/><br/>However, the oil field is so huge that the players have to memorize where which oil quality is to be found. Moreover, the competing players are likely to interefere with the player's intentions.<br/><br/>To win the game, it is mandatory to collect oil qualities of different kinds, always keeping an eye on the ever changing prices. Balancing this will help !<br/><br/><br/>From the Boardgame News annoucement.<br/><br/>As for the game play, Ghawar is a pick-up-and-deliver game with a roll-and-move mechanism on top of a memory element. On a 13x13 game board, 36 oil platforms are laid out in a 6x6 square with one empty space between each pair of platforms. Players seed these platforms with 36 coloured &quot;oil stones&quot; with nine cubes in each of four colors.<br/><br/>Players take turns rolling two dice and placing one of their five oil wells on the unoccupied platform at this location in the grid; if a player rolls 2-5, for example, she can choose row 2, column 5 or the other way around. Once all the oil rigs are placed, the second half of the game begins.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player either rolls a die to move the truck, train or both vehicles a number of spaces equal to the die roll or moves one of the oil rigs to an adjacent location, most likely covering an oil stone previously exposed.<br/><br/>If a player's truck starts or ends its movement by an oil rig and doesn't already have a load, the truck's owner can lift the oil rig and buy the oil stone underneath it, paying the rig's owner the current value of the oil.<br/><br/>You can't purchase oil stones that aren't covered as there must be a well in place to bring the oil to the surface. You must bring the oil to your side of the board to deliver it before you can pick up another oil stone with the truck.<br/><br/>When your train ends its movement by an empty platform the train picks up the platform so that you can carry it back to your camp. At the end of the game, players lose points based on their relative standings in the number of platforms collected.<br/><br/>The game ends once all the oil stones have been delivered. If any player has failed to collect at least one of each type of stone, that player loses the game. Players still in the game score points for each oil stone they possess, for having more of their favored type of oil than anyone else, for collecting barrels, and for having lots of money due to sales. If you have the fewest stones of a type, less money than anyone else, and fewer platforms than someone else, you'll lose points. The player with the high score wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Johannes Halbig"], "categories": ["Arabian", "Exploration", "Industry / Manufacturing", "Trains", "Transportation"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Ghawar", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 45, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 5.25, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.82003, "numcomments": 2}, "91038": {"mechanics": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Dice Rolling", "Modular Board", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "usersrated": 12, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic900986.jpg", "wishing": 14, "owned": 43, "trading": 3, "id": 91038, "yearpublished": 2011, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 3, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic900986_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Self-Published)", "(Web published)"], "families": ["Aether Captains Series", "Steampunk"], "description": "Air Pirates have gathered at the mysterious Black Canyon to decide who shall lead them next.

You are allowed up to 2 rolls for each throw and may re-roll 0, 1, 2, or 3 dice, as you choose, on your second roll. Each player will make 10 throws to build and stock their ships. Make your throw and pass the dice to the next player until everyone has had their 10 throws.<br/><br/>Different color dice combinations will allow you to activate a section of your ship (you only activate a ship section once) and then stock it with resources for the battle phase.

If you use a resource, rotate the resource die face down one number (i.e. 3 to 2) on that ship section. If you use the last resource, remove the die from the ship section.<br/><br/>Then the hidden dice of both players are revealed. Whoever has the highest total is the winner of that skirmish.

A decade later, its Marxists had lost their top leaders and rural sanctuary, its big drug bosses were dead or in prison, and its paramilitaries were negotiating demobilization.  The Government had extended its writ to most of the countryside, restored its popularity, and improved the economy and respect for human rights.<br/><br/>Andean Abyss takes 1 to 4 players into this multifaceted campaign for control of Colombia:  guerrillas and police, kidnapping and drug war, military sweeps and terror.  Each of four factions deploys distinct capabilities and tactics to influence Colombian affairs and achieve differing goals.  Players place and maneuver 160 wooden pieces across a colorful map and exploit event cards that cannot be fully predicted.  Accessible mechanics and components put the emphasis on game play, but Andean Abyss also provides an engrossing model of insurgency and counterinsurgency in Colombia&mdash;smoothly accounting for population control, lines of communication, terrain, intelligence, foreign aid, sanctuaries, and a host of other political, military, and economic factors.<br/><br/>A New Kind of Card-Assisted Wargame<br/> From the award-winning designer of Wilderness War and Labyrinth, Andean Abyss features unique mechanics relating events and operations that guarantee difficult player decisions with each card flip.  Most of the game&rsquo;s 72 events are dual-use, representing alternative historical paths:  players can choose either version of the event or from an array of operations and special faction activities.  Every choice has implications for how the next card will be played.  There is no hand management:  the focus is on the map and on planning for the foreseeable&mdash;and the unforeseeable.  Die rolls are only a small part of game:  the key to victory is not luck but the ability to organize the most effective campaign.<br/><br/>Multiplayer, 2-Player, Solitaire<br/><br/>Andean Abyss provides up to 4 players with contrasting roles and overlapping victory conditions for rich diplomatic interaction.  For 2- or 3-player games, players can represent alliances of factions, or the game system can control non-player factions .  Or a single player as the Colombian Government can take on the leftist FARC, the right-wing AUC, and the narco-trafficking cartels.

A fun Christmas-spirited murder mystery party for 8-16+ guests ages 13 to 112! There is an expandable Elf character that can be expanded to as many optional characters as you need!<br/><br/>Mystery Synopsis: It was time for the annual pre-Christmas meeting at Mr. and Mrs. Santa Claus's home in the North Pole. This was the bustling time of the year when the Christmas workers needed to stop working for a moment and come together to discuss how Christmas was unraveling. The meeting attendees arrived as planned at Santa's home. They enjoyed appetizers and engaged in fun Christmas trivia questions while waiting for the meeting to begin. They had fun with an exciting game of 'What Christmas Thing am I' followed by a challenging game of Christmas Taboo. Mrs. Claus served a delicious dinner along with an entertaining Christmas Scramble challenge. The meeting was productive and the Christmas spirit was soaring high until to everyone's shock...a murder occurred! The Christmas characters all rallied together to figure out whodunit before this scandalous murder ruined Christmas! After everyone accused who they believed the murderer was...everyone came clean with their involvement in the crime and...the murderer confessed! While the group awaited the North Pole P.D. to arrive and arrest the accused, the group played a fun game of Christmas Charades. Overall, Christmas had its issues behind the scenes - but the nice boys and girls got their presents on Christmas morning according to plan.<br/><br/>home page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.mymysteryparty.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mymysteryparty.com/</a><br/><br/>", "minplayers": 8, "averageweight": 4.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": [], "categories": ["Murder/Mystery", "Party Game"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "T'was A Night of Pandemonium: A Christmas Murder", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 240, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 2}, "86992": {"mechanics": ["Commodity Speculation", "Modular Board", "Tile Placement", "Trading"], "usersrated": 3, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic870593.jpg", "wishing": 3, "owned": 18, "trading": 2, "id": 86992, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 3, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic870593_t.jpg", "publishers": ["nestorgames"], "families": [], "description": "Expansion for the base game 'The Aztec Market'.<br/><br/>In November 2010, NESTORGAMES ran a contest on boardgamegeek.com, where the participants had to create new tiles for the original game &quot;The Aztec Market&quot;.

For 2-6 players, this game is a shark-filled, blood pumping experience, where all players draw from the same central deck. Each player manages their hand of cards - to defend their beaches with Fend off with High-pitched Screams, Brody's Service Revolver, Improvised Explosives, Rifle and Gas Cannister Ploy, Crushed Beer Cans, Kick feet desperately, while shrieking, The Orca, and Undersea Power Cable Trick, etc, as well as play scarily large Great White Sharks against their opponent's swimwear-clad vacationers.<br/><br/>Each player may also recruit grizzled experts from around the world to safeguard their beaches from closure. Such shark hunters include Quint, Matt Hooper, Philip FitzRoyce, Hoagie Newcombe, and Chief Brody.<br/><br/>The mayors can also utilise, to save themselves from monstrous fish, some of the following example cards: &quot;Sh-sh-sh-shaaaRRRRKKKKK!&quot; and Eat Screaming Woman - Brandishing a Flare gun while soaked in petrol and Moonlit feed, and the strutting Adonis, Shelby Overman, and Eat Powerboat Water-skier, and &quot;That's some bad hat, Harry,&quot; and Eat Diving School and &quot;Overman was killed inside the park.

Players can also, at any time, spend cash to alter Shark Attack dice rolls, setting the situations up whereby opponents' bathers may be devoured by monstrous Great Whites. Also, some cards, like &quot;Beach Closed,&quot; cost the target mayor cash, from revenues lost, forcing them to buy less Anti-shark gear. Money is generally in short supply. Steal or swindle it from other mayors if you can.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 10 vacationers and $10,000.<br/><br/>Last mayor with his beach still full of bathers wins.<br/><br/>NOTE: There is no player elimination. When a mayor has run out of holidaymakers, all his cards and poker chips are removed, and then he can only play Shark Attack cards on the players remaining - attacking the mayor with the most vacationers left in play (he's got the most bathers in the sea).

At the beginning of each of the eight rounds, there is a offers phase, in which players bid to secure Key West cards, which represent, for example, ownership of bridges and plantations and other benefits for the subsequent actions round. Individual actions are a finite and players will need to approach them tactically.  It often won't be possible to do everything one wants and what not to do an agonizing decision.<br/><br/>Both experienced players and families will find something to like in Key West. There are seven different paths for generating victory points, but those who try to get involved everywhere won't succeed. The focus should be on three or four programs.

It is intended to be suitable for refighting actual battles as well as for hypothetical scenarios, one-of, equal-strength competition style games, and free form campaigns in which the tabletop encounters arise from strategic decisions made by the players. It is worth pointing out here that although some purists regard the last three options as somehow inferior to the historical refight, they generally present players with more challenging situations and allow them more opportunity to exercise their tactical skills, without the benefit of hindsight. Such games can be just as faithful to the &quot;spirit&quot; of the period as a slavish reconstruction, and are often more fun. These rules are intended to give the players an enjoyable and fast moving experience, while at the same time reflecting - as far as is possible with what is essentially a form of entertainment - the conditions of the real conflict. A game involving several hundred figures a side can easily be complete in an evening. After a few attempts you will probably be able to remember most of the rules which you will need, and so will be able to keep things moving without constantly referring to the book. This leaves you free to enjoy the game and admire your carefully painted figures - which is what it is about, after all.&quot; <br/>From the Authors Introduction<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 2.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Chris Peers"], "categories": ["American Civil War", "Miniatures", "Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Advance the Flag", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "91191": {"mechanics": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Dice Rolling"], "usersrated": 5, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic909374.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 26, "trading": 3, "id": 91191, "yearpublished": 2009, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic909374_t.jpg", "publishers": ["4Kids Entertainment", "4Kidz, Inc."], "families": [], "description": "Set in the Chaotic universe and packed with 25 miniatures and 3D components, Underworld Battle has the players taking the role of OverWorld heroes fighting monsters as they advancing through the UnderWorld City Battle Arena.

The game involves selection, bowling, batting, and active fielding, allowing for short over fast action games through to the complex realms of strategy found in test play. Although, like with cricket itself, the basics are simple and easily learnt, it will inevitably take a lifetime to master.<br/><br/>No prior knowledge of cricket is needed to play the game which is suitable for the whole family and up to 22 players. In essence the side that scores the most &quot;runs&quot; wins, though selecting the right players, the order they play, and where they are positioned all affect the outcome of the game. The basics of Wicked Wickets are really quite simple; the bowler throws the ball, in this case the red ball shaped die, and the batsman &quot;hits&quot; it by throwing the buff bat-shaped die. Adding the scores together shows how far the ball goes using the long flight measure. If the batsman's score is higher than the bowlers, the ball &quot;flies&quot; in the air; if the bowler's score is higher than the batsman's, then it is struck along the ground. The yellow counter and dice are used to show which direction the ball goes. The short pace measure is simply used to measure the distance players move and the green die is mostly used for fielding. The game cards give the individual abilities of the players affecting how and where they are used. However, as with most games there is often more to it than first meets the eye. --From the publisher<br/><br/>Official website: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.boadiceasbackyard.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.boadiceasbackyard.com/</a><br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Richard Holgate"], "categories": ["Sports"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Wicked Wickets", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 90, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 4.5, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 3.5, "numcomments": 0}, "87097": {"mechanics": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "usersrated": 24, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic885182.jpg", "wishing": 5, "owned": 225, "trading": 2, "id": 87097, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 5, "wanting": 4, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic885182_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Multi-Man Publishing"], "families": ["Advanced Squad Leader"], "description": "&quot;Out of the Bunker&quot; is a package of 14 ASL scenarios from the ASL Fanzine &quot;Dispatches from the Bunker&quot;.<br/><br/>The scenarios include some of MMP's favorites:<br/><br/>     Riding the Coattails, Poland 1939<br/>     Point 247, France 1940<br/>     Brasche Encounter, France 1940<br/>     Headhunting for Bloody Huns, Crete 1941<br/>     Clearing Kamienka, Russia 1941<br/>     First Clash in Tunisia, Tunisia 1942<br/>     Crisis at Kasserine, Tunisia 1943<br/>     Unhappy Trails, Bougainville 1943<br/>     First Crack at Hellzapoppin' Ridge, Bougainville 1943<br/>     The Men From Zadig, France 1944<br/>     Avril Action, France 1944<br/>     Block at Ville-Sur-Illon, France 1944<br/>     A Hotly Contested Crossroads, Germany 1945<br/>     Pursuing Kobayashi, The Philippines 1945<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 4.6, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Tom Morin", "Carl Nogueira"], "categories": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Wargame", "World War II"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Out of the Bunker #1", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.70833, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.90895, "numcomments": 11}, "87098": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 0, "image": "", "wishing": 1, "owned": 1, "trading": 0, "id": 87098, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "", "publishers": ["AMJI Games"], "families": [], "description": "Paraphrased from the game's instruction sheet:<br/><br/>A word game for two to four players, utilizing a deck of 54 cards with individual letters on them (2 of each constanant other than Z (of which there is one) and 3 of A,E,I,O and U.

Players then decide on an appropriate Solution card to use as a positive strategy to address the anxiety in the situation.

Relaxation Cards calm down by using deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, and meditation. Coping Cards distract by diverting attention away from anxious feelings to fun or effortful activities. When the problem has been successfully solved with one of the Solution cards, the player then tosses the Situation card into the Worried Waters, and the Solution card is used to create the foundation or top of a bridge.

The 100-card deck contains fifty creatures with different characteristics that determine how the creature interacts with the orbs (throw accuracy, catching ability, and throwing range), how fast a creature can move, and how effective it is in battle. Many creatures also have unique magic abilities that can be used to manipulate gameplay.<br/><br/>When players summon creatures, corresponding creature tokens (miniature cards that stand erect in cardstands) enter the 20x20 square gameboard, known as the Arena, where the orb and portal tokens await the contestants. In a four-player game, players may compete in teams of two. Goals are scored by creatures that maneuver an orb token onto a portal token by picking up, carrying, handing off, and throwing the orb with their creature tokens. Additionally, players can score goals (known as Skins) by successfully destroying opponents' creatures in combat. Combat results are determined by dice rolls as are the success of throws and catches of the orb between creatures. A number of Alter Reality cards allow players to change the values of individual rolls which make the outcome of every roll something that can quickly be challenged.<br/><br/>Enchantment cards can be played on creatures to grant them enhanced stats or new abilities as well as make them hardier in combat. Event cards, such a Lightning Storms or Fumbles can change the flow the game in seconds forcing players to constantly rethink their strategies for scoring or engaging in combat.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player or team reaches three goals, one of which must be a non-skins goal.

On each turn, the player plays one tile onto the board and hopes to score points.  Tiles have dots, passageways, and gates on them.  To score, the player looks at the dot on their tile and finds the shortest path to a dot of the same color (there are six different colors).  The player then counts the number of tiles in that path and that's the number of points the player scores.  If there are multiple shortest paths, then the player can choose which path to score.  This may make a difference depending on the gates on the different paths.<br/><br/>If the player scores on a path which has gates on it, the player gets the benefit of those gates.  Yellow gates give the player more points.  Pink gates give the player peeks.  Orange gates give the player tokens.<br/><br/>Each turn, the player plays one tile and then draws one tile.

Play it to the end until you are able to retire and enjoy the American dream.<br/><br/>To start the game you need a minimum of two (2) players and a maximum of twelve (12), the more players in the game, the better the game runs, between seven and ten players would be ideal, although the game&rsquo;s dynamics allows other players to join in at any time, even after the game has already started, as long as they start up from the square marked as &lsquo;Start&rsquo;. Any of the players can also double up as a the Bank and all players get a &lsquo;Profession&rsquo; card and 5.000 (five thousand) game dollars to start.<br/><br/>Put the two sets of cards on their appropriate location on the board, that is, the cards that say 'Professions' on the space marked 'Professions' and the 'Main Board' cards on the spot next to them, you pick up a &lsquo;Main Board&rsquo; card every time the board instructs you to pick up a card and follow its instructions.<br/><br/>The game is uni-directional.   Use one die, this will tell you the number of squares that you have to move your token.  Follow the instructions of the square where you land. If you have to go back any space(s) then follow the instructions for that square also.  Except for the Professions cards, all other cards go back to the bottom of the pile.  If you get deported you must start again from the beginning (JFK).   Lose a day is the same as miss a turn.   You can be married in your country and still get married in this game. (This is just a game)<br/><br/>Profession:   The Professions card, stays with you while you are playing, since it indicates the salary your are to collect every week.    If you get another profession card,  you can keep it if you wish hold two or three jobs at the same time. You can hold up to three jobs.<br/><br/>Money:   Follow the instructions on the game board only when you land on them, not as you pass. (Except when it comes to 'Pay day', every time you pass Pay Day you get pay, even if you don't land exactly on it).  That is collect your salary as you pass.  This is the only exception, you are entitle to your salary as you pass, you don't need to have an exact landing, but if you land right on the Pay day square, collect twice your salary.  All bills have the value of an imaginary game dollar, whether Euro, Liras, Sucres, Pesos, Franks, etc., so 1000 liras is the same as 1000 dollars or 1000 Pesos, for the purposes of the game.<br/><br/>End of game: All players that retire win.   To retire, only a perfect landing on the final square is allowed.   At the end of the game, if you have 6 or less spaces to go, you need that exact number to come out on the die in order to beat the game, if you get more on the die than what you need,  wait for your next turn before trying again.   Your game ends on the square that reads: Retire happy, where the retired players can walk into the Sunshine scenery area, to wait for the rest of the players (Imagine that!) Retire back to your country, move to Florida or Hawaii, whatever your dream might be.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Jorge E.

The main rules and mechanics from the classic wargame remain all the same, but the original board is replaced by one depicting the city of Rio de Janeiro. This new board is divided in 42 &quot;favelas&quot; - how the slums and shanty towns are called in Brazil -, which are arranged in six different sections, following the geopolitical areas of the city of Rio de Janeiro.<br/><br/>In addition, the colored armies now represent the different groups struggling to control the &quot;wonderful city&quot;. Two colors represent the government forces: black is the &quot;BOPE&quot; (Special Police Operations Battalion) and blue is the &quot;Pol&iacute;cia Militar&quot; (Military Police). Three colors represent the major criminal organizations in Rio: red for &quot;Comando Vermelho&quot;, green for &quot;Terceiro Comando&quot; and yellow for &quot;Amigos dos Amigos&quot;. The white pieces represent the several other militias &quot;Mil&iacute;cias&quot; that also play a role in the urban war.<br/><br/>Fabio Lopez, the Brazilian designer who created the game, has already informed that he didn't intend to publish the game or even share it for free. His purpose with War in Rio was solely &quot;to generate a discussion through a shameless invitation to enjoyment.&quot; However, such an original idea could not be ignored by Brazilian players and several anonymous fans soon joined forces to recreate the map and the cards based in the original photos posted by Lopez in his blog.<br/><br/>Given the subversive status of this idea, this game probably will never be officially published.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Fabio Lopez"], "categories": ["Humor", "Print & Play", "Territory Building", "Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "War in Rio", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 120, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "84464": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 352, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic998726.jpg", "wishing": 192, "owned": 577, "trading": 6, "id": 84464, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 24, "wanting": 110, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic998726_t.jpg", "publishers": ["HABA - Habermaa\u00df GmbH"], "families": ["Tier auf Tier"], "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Flamingo, giraffe, panther, bat and iguana start the adventure of their life and together set off on a big journey.

In HopperDame with promotion rule you win by capturing all the opponent's pieces. Pieces move forwards and sideways, orthogonally or diagonally, by shifting to an adjacent square, or by jumping over an adjacent friendly piece (also termed 'hopper'). Jumps must only occur over a piece of the same colour. It's not allowable to step or jump backwards. The exception to this is the &quot;king&quot;, which can jump over any piece, and step in all directions.<br/><br/>To promote to king one must conquer the &quot;castles&quot;, that is, the corner squares behind the enemy position, by holding both these positions with a piece, so called &quot;double-promotion&quot;. If a piece steps or jumps into the enemy corner then it is promoted to king only if the other enemy corner is already occupied by a friendly piece. Also, a piece which steps into the corner square may later be promoted if the other corner has subsequently become occupied by a friendly piece. The promotion is then done by dropping the piece on the same square. But this costs a move.<br/><br/>HopperDame employs the rule of exchange-capture: the counter jumps over a friendly counter. If the square where it lands is occupied by an enemy counter, then this is captured. It is only when leaping that the counter can make captures. A leaping counter may continue to leap over friendly counters until there are no more to leap over or the player decides to stop. It's not allowable to jump back to the square you just came from.<br/><br/>Note that capture is only made when jumping. Thus, a single piece cannot make a capture by itself. The exception to this is the king, which has an additional capture method: it can capture an adjacent enemy piece directly, like a king in chess.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["M.

The game was created around the mid 16th century (presumably by priests) and is based on earlier large board shogi games. Before the rediscovery of Taikyoku Shogi in 1997, Tai Shogi was believed to be the largest playable chess variant (if not board game) ever. It has not been shown that Taikyoku Shogi was ever widely played. One game may be played over several long sessions and require each player to make over a thousand moves.&quot; - Wikipedia<br/><br/>Two players, Black and White, play on a board ruled into a grid of 36 ranks (rows) by 36 files (columns) with a total of 1,296 squares. The squares are undifferentiated by marking or color. Each player has a set of 402 wedge-shaped pieces of 209 different types. All pieces are the same color. The orientation of the piece tells which side it is on. The pieces are wedge-shaped with the name of the piece written in kanji on it's face in black. If the piece can promote, then the name of the piece's promoted form is written on the back face, usually in red. Pieces are turned over when promoted.<br/><br/>An opposing piece is captured by displacement: That is, if a piece moves to a square occupied by an opposing piece, the opposing piece is displaced and removed from the board. A piece cannot move to a square occupied by a friendly piece. Unlike standard Shogi, pieces may not be dropped back into play after being captured.<br/><br/>Like other large board Shogi variants, this game uses the promotion-by-capture rule. When a piece first makes a capture, it promotes if it can (this is compulsory, not optional). few important pieces do not promote. Promotion has the effect of changing how a piece moves.<br/><br/>The players alternate making a move, with Black moving first. A move consists of moving a single piece on the board and potentially displacing (capturing) an opposing piece, promoting that piece if it is able to promote.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to capture the opponent&rsquo;s King and Crown Princes, of which players start with one of each. Both pieces must be captured to win. Also present is a piece called the Drunken Elephant, which if promoted becomes another Crown Prince which would also need to be captured to win.<br/><br/>A player who makes an illegal move loses immediately.

It was the first major battle of the Hundred Years War, and although it was a naval encounter &ndash; the English fleet attacked their French adversaries in the estuary before Bruges &ndash; it was decided by sword, hammer and arrow. Confined to cog and barge, retreat was not an option for marines in this desperate fight. Despite being outnumbered and in foreign waters, the English fleet annihilated its adversary. Edward captured nearly all his rival&rsquo;s ships and slew a horde of soldiers and mariners that day, boasting that bodies were washing onto Flemish beaches for days.<br/><br/>Designed by Jeremy White, this is an unusual game. Players &ldquo;build&rdquo; the battlefield as they go. By navigating their squadrons of galleys, nefs and cogs through the estuary they create the &ldquo;terrain&rdquo; upon which the knights and men-at-arms will vie for supremacy. Success hinges on the ability to deliver marines and archers against weak points, or in giving your opponent no choice but to hit your fleet where it is strongest. The English will have the longbow and a high freeboard, as well as the benefit of the wind gauge in many scenarios, but if played smartly the French will manage to offset those advantages, applying his weight of numbers irresistibly against the English king&rsquo;s bid to rule France. Scenarios treat the variety of questions that puzzle historians about this battle, and since the game is not complex and plays under three hours, it offers a chance to explore many angles of historical interpretation.<br/><br/>Right Fierce &amp; Terrible has one 22 by 34 inch map, oversized die cut counters, accessible rules with extensive illustrated examples of play, and seven scenarios with set-up diagrams for a quick start. Regardless of the scenario played, however, casualties will be horrendous, and there are tough decisions to make. Archery, ramming, grappling and melee are the tools of conquest here. The battle is likely to ebb and flow, squadrons can be captured, liberated, and captured again. Leaders, including King Edward, can also be captured and liberated, or killed by a stray arrow, or if nabbed, executed on the spot. Would Edward&rsquo;s demise have spared Flanders and France one hundred years of war? Knights can perform acts of heroism to avert disaster, but at great cost to themselves. Each fleet&rsquo;s morale will gradually deteriorate as the battle grows more desperate&hellip;until at last, one fleet finally breaks and the day is won!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.7778, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Jeremy White"], "categories": ["Medieval", "Nautical", "Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Right Fierce & Terrible: Sluys 1340", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 180, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.12069, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.07202, "numcomments": 26}, "91440": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 54, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic998251.jpg", "wishing": 11, "owned": 99, "trading": 1, "id": 91440, "yearpublished": 2011, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 6, "wanting": 5, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic998251_t.jpg", "publishers": ["HABA - Habermaa\u00df GmbH"], "families": ["Animals: Dinosaurs"], "description": "Tim the dinosaur researcher has come upon another find in Expedition Dino, and the players need to help him recover the bones, with one player being crowned as the best bone finder.<br/><br/>To set up the game, the dinosaur figure is surrounded by rock cubes, each of which bear bone symbols on some of their sides.

You'll need to manage your hand of land cards carefully in order to keep moving and not let another dwarf take the gold you were eyeing.<br/><br/>Zwerg Riese includes variant rules for more experienced dwarves, one that puts a storm cloud in play on the board.<br/><br/>Awards:<br/>Zwerg Riese / Rik le g&eacute;ant has won the As d&rsquo;Or - Jeu de l&rsquo;Ann&eacute;e Enfant 2012<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.6667, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Marco Teubner"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Children's Game", "Fantasy"], "name": "Giant Dwarf", "playingtime": 20, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 6.69231, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.07486, "numcomments": 10}, "91443": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Role Playing"], "usersrated": 6, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic906970.png", "wishing": 1, "owned": 40, "trading": 0, "id": 91443, "yearpublished": 1987, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 2, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic906970_t.png", "publishers": ["FASA"], "families": ["BattleTech"], "description": "From the back of the book:<br/><br/>&quot;COMSTAR ANSWERS ALL...<br/><br/><br/>        Who was Claudius the Cruel?<br/>        What is the hottest rock group in the Inner Sphere?<br/>        Which mercenary leader has a crush on Melissa Steiner?<br/><br/><br/>Precariously poised between the fierce eagle of House Marik and the voracious dragon of House Kurita, House Steiner fights a desperate battle to protect the worlds, industries and peoples of the Lyran Commonwealth.

Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.<br/><br/>The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.<br/><br/>The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds.  Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles.  At the beginning of each round all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die.  A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die.  During each round players take their turns in the current turn order.  During his turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions: 1) take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of his dice and place it in the staging area on his player board, 2) take a settlement tile from the staging area of his player board to a space on his player board with a number matching one of his dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile, 3) deliver goods with a number matching one of his dice, or 4) take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of his dice.  In addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on his player board.  If an action triggers the award of victory points, those points are immediately recorded.  Each settlement tile offers a benefit, additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points.  Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.<br/><br/>The game ends when the last player finishes his turn of the fifth round of the fifth phase.  Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers, and undelivered goods.  Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The player with the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>The rules include basic and advanced versions.<br/><br/>This game is #14 in the Alea big box series.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 3.0446, "bayesaverage": 7.99524, "designers": ["Stefan Feld"], "categories": ["Dice", "Medieval", "Territory Building"], "name": "Die Burgen von Burgund", "playingtime": 90, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "10"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "8"}], "average": 8.11077, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.22798, "numcomments": 4493}, "91467": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 0, "image": "", "wishing": 0, "owned": 2, "trading": 0, "id": 91467, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "", "publishers": ["(Web published)"], "families": ["Country: England", "Stonehenge Games"], "description": "Number of players: 3&ndash;5<br/><br/>Object of the game: By casting a series of spells, be the first to have all ten spirits of your color arrive at the base of your trilithon.<br/><br/>Equipment: Ten disks (spirits), figure (druid spirit master, representing the player), and ten bars (magical connections) of one color for each player, one trilithon for each player, and the deck of cards.<br/><br/>Ending the Game<br/><br/>The game ends when a player gets all ten of his or her spirits to the base of their trilithon, and that player wins!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Jeffrey D.

Not surprisingly, the board and pieces were very similar to those that we had developed, so it was fairly simple to transfer most of our ideas to match those provided. Our game links Stonehenge to the magical powers of the Earth and other elements and is basically a battle for magical supremacy.<br/><br/>Number of players: 3&ndash;5<br/><br/>Object of the game: The object of the game is to use your magical powers (represented by the cards) to convince the local clans (represented by disks on the bluestones) and spirits (represented by bars on the outer ring) that you are the druid most able to carry out the solstice rituals. Building trilithons and preparing the altar stone may assist along the way and it is vital that you keep up with the necessary preparations to avoid offending the spirits.<br/>Getting Started<br/><br/>Equipment: First Druid uses all of the pieces provided in the basic game box. Each player uses the pieces of one colour (along with the trilithon card of his or her colour), so if there are less than five players some colours will not be used.<br/><br/>Throughout these rules, the plastic figures are referred to as 'druids'.<br/><br/>Ending the Game<br/><br/>When the first player has moved his druid all the way around the ring, the game is at an end. Merely streaking ahead is not enough to secure victory, however; it is the support and alleigances secured along the way that decide which druid is the First Druid!<br/><br/>Each player has as many points as the number his druid piece is on at the end, plus additional points for allied tribes and spirits. Tribes and Spirits count 1 point for the first in a run, 2 for the second, 3 for the third etc.<br/><br/>So, the game is a complex balance of using your magical powers to race ahead and gaining allies. In addition, trilothon stones enhance your supply of magic, and dressing the alter stone may move you ahead or even move your rivals backwards!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Ian McDonald", "Stephen Thomson"], "categories": ["Racing"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "First Druid", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "91483": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 0, "image": "", "wishing": 0, "owned": 2, "trading": 0, "id": 91483, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "", "publishers": ["(Web published)"], "families": ["Country: England", "Stonehenge Games"], "description": "Meets &amp; Bounds is intended as a fast-playing game which has players attempting to optimize their score while managing the uncertainty of what opportunities chance will offer.<br/><br/>Number of players: 2&ndash;5<br/><br/>Object of the game: In Meets &amp; Bounds players vie to control as many spaces as possible. Each player will attempt to establish a sector of his own while thwarting his opponent's efforts. Each player will be rewarded for the size of his sector, as well as the number of groups and bounded disks he can contain within his sector. Some players may even form more than one sector.

A sector is a range of numbered spaces with no disks of an opponent within, and bounded by 2 of the player&rsquo;s disks. Players also score victory points for friendly disks within their sectors. Finally, players score points for groups of 2 or more of their own playing pieces in contiguous spaces.<br/><br/>The player with the most victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/>Sectors: Score 1 point for each numbered space of the range. A range is always the largest possible area bounded by the pieces of a single color.<br/><br/>Bounded Pieces: Score 1 point for each interior disk within a sector. Bounded pieces never define a range.<br/><br/>Groups of 2: 1 point per piece. The two pieces must be contiguous.<br/><br/>Groups of 3 or more: 2 points per piece. Groups must be contiguous.<br/><br/>Scoring Example: White has pieces in 6 night, 7 day, 9 day, 12 day, 13 night. There are no pieces belonging to opponents in any spaces between 6-13. White will score 8 points for their sector. White will score 3 points for Bounded Pieces (7, 9, 12). White will score 2 points for the group of two pieces that are contiguous (12 day &amp; 13 night).

The game covers battles and campaigns in the Mediterranean and Near East from the Persian defeat at Marathon in 490 BC to Caesar's victory at Pharsalus in 48 BC.  It has been exhaustively tested and refined over the past several years, and is based on Professor Philip Sabin's decades of research and simulation design on ancient warfare; and it includes an updated copy of his book, with extensive historical and design notes on every scenario.<br/><br/>The game can be fought on three levels - the grand tactical, the grand strategic, or a combination of the two.  At the grand tactical level, 1 or 2 players may refight any of 35 different land battles such as Leuctra, Gaugamela, Raphia, Cannae, Cynoscephalae or the Sambre - far more than in any other single boxed game.  At the grand strategic level, 1 to 4 players may refight the epic duels of the two centuries from 350 to 150 BC, starting with the eclipse of Achaemenid Persia by Alexander of Macedon, and ending with Hannibal's campaigns and the conquest of Carthage and the Hellenistic states by the resurgent Roman republic.  The most ambitious games combine these two levels, and see 1 to 4 players using tactical battles to resolve strategic campaigns across part or all of this two century period, or else refighting a series of historical battles to decide conflicts such as the three-cornered contest for dominance between Athens, Sparta and Thebes from the start of the Peloponnesian War to the death of Epaminondas.<br/><br/>The accent throughout is on combining historical accuracy with speed and accessibility.  The free-standing strategic game may be completed in just 30 minutes, while individual land battles may be re-fought in two hours or less.  There is constant player interaction, and a series of tortuous dilemmas - how should the scarce command points be allocated across the battlefront, which troop types should be put in the lead against particular opponents, should units attack all-out at the cost of becoming exhausted themselves, and should generals join the fighting to rally their disheartened men at the risk of being killed and so making things far worse?  The game includes all the many troop types from hoplites, legionaries, phalangites and archers to cataphracts, scythed chariots and war elephants, and it includes simple rules to reflect the huge differences in generalship and troop quality and to allow outclassed armies to win a handicapped 'game victory' even if they are defeated on the field, as long as they do better than they did historically.  All aspects of the game are avowedly solitaire-friendly, and can be run by a single player swapping sides just as easily as by one or more players per side.<br/><br/>Tactical battles are fought on a 5 x 4 grid of full-colour 5 inch square hard mounted terrain tiles, which dovetail to form any desired battlefield.  The individually die-cut counters have rounded corners and are also in full-colour; they depict the various different troop types. The strategic game is fought on a hard mounted map showing the area from Spain to India.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 3.2, "bayesaverage": 5.86624, "designers": ["Philip Sabin"], "categories": ["Ancient", "Game System", "Wargame"], "name": "Lost Battles", "playingtime": 140, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "2529"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "235"}], "average": 7.96372, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.56152, "numcomments": 113}, "87422": {"mechanics": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2679716.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 4, "trading": 0, "id": 87422, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2679716_t.jpg", "publishers": ["M\u00fccke Spiele", "Schyns Didaktische Spiele"], "families": ["Desert Theme", "Game of Goose"], "description": "Huckepack durch die W&uuml;ste - freely translated &quot;Porters through the Desert&quot; - is a adventurous dice game.<br/><br/>Game components:<br/>- a cloth game board, 49 x 49 cm<br/>- 4 sets of 3 wooden game pawns (12 in total)<br/>- 1 die<br/>- the rules<br/><br/>From the game:<br/>Somewhere in Arabia, in a small settlement on the border of the never ending desert, a great tension can be felt. In the shadow of an old palm tree four bold nomad sons are planning a dare-devil adventure. What is their plan? Will they really try to cross the desert by the infamous west route? Don't they know the treacherous quicksand and all those other dangers which lie in wait for them? Have no fear! With cautiousness, good companionship and some luck this route is passable. Each caravan still has one place open - dare this adventure and join them!<br/><br/>The rules:<br/>Each player has three pawns with which to reach the large oasis in the middle of the board. Pawns are moved by throwing the die. A pawn can get stuck in quicksand, and then has to be rescued by another pawn of the same player. (Optional: or by rolling a six.) A rescued pawn is carried on the back of the other to the next oasis, where the pawn which was stuck has to rest till another pawn ends its turn there, or a six is rolled by the player.<br/><br/>When a pawn ends its move on a field where another pawn already is, it can climb on the others back, and be carried/ported by it. This is possible with both your own or other players pawns. (Multiply carrying is allowed.) However: a carried pawn should hop off  before reaching the next oasis, as once the porter reaches it, it will drop off all carried pawns in the oasis! And likewise with resting pawns from being stuck in the quicksand: formerly carried pawns will have to rest till another pawn ends its turn there, or a six is rolled by the corresponding player.<br/><br/>When a pawn ends it turn on a place from which a short track continues (shown by a road sign), this may be taken on the next turn. Any carried pawns are carried along.<br/>To reach the end oasis, a pawn has to reach it, either by throwing the required number exactly or higher.<br/><br/>Winner of this adventurous journey is the player who has crossed the desert with his or her three pawns first.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["(Uncredited)", "Barbara Schyns"], "categories": ["Dice"], "name": "Huckepack durch die W\u00fcste", "playingtime": 45, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 1}, "83329": {"mechanics": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic820482.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 83329, "yearpublished": 1998, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic820482_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Mattel"], "families": ["3D Games", "Celebrities: Walt Disney", "Toy Story"], "description": "From the box: &quot;Buzz wants to fly...but a tangle of toys stands in his way!

The game may be played with normal dice, but one 3 face must be marked to represent the wild symbol.<br/>Setup continues by rolling the dice six times (3d6) and laying cubes that represent the gift targets on the resulting spaces, which are numbered from 3-18 (1 and 2 are the poles, and will never have gift targets placed on them.)<br/>The dice and the player's tokens are manipulated using the dice.

Movement is orthogonal only, never diagonal.<br/>Keep one sleigh to move the sleign one space orthogonally, two to move three, three to move hour.  In addition, if the player's token is in the same space as the sleigh, you must roll two sleighs to board the sleigh.

Move the sleigh to bring it closer to you, or to keep the other player from intercepting it.  The sleigh may not be moved remotely if the other player is riding it.<br/>Roll and keep three springs to eject a player riding the sleigh back to his or her base.

Each team selects a playing piece and places it on the Start Space on the board.<br/><br/>Split the players into two teams. The oldest player in each team will become the first Question Master for their team. The team containing the youngest player will start.<br/><br/>THE QUESTIONS<br/>There are four questions on the back of each card. The first question is beside the Red Square followed by the White, Blue and Green.<br/><br/>There are three kinds of question cards:<br/><br/>Picture cards - on which there is a picture that the questions relate to.<br/><br/>Common Theme Cards - on which all the answers have a common theme.<br/><br/>Pot Luck Cards - on which there are random Best of British questions.<br/><br/>THE BOARD<br/>The board is a path from the outer Start space into the Winning Zone in the centre of the board. The spaces on the board are made up of the four different colours that match those on the Question Cards. The first four spaces on the board match the order of those on the cards.<br/><br/>After the first four spaces the colour order becomes random so just answering one question correctly can sometimes mean a big leap forward.<br/><br/>PLAY<br/>The Question Master for the team containing the youngest player picks up the first Question Card from the box making sure the answers are concealed from all the players on both teams.<br/><br/>If it is a Picture Card, the picture is shown to all the players on both teams. If it is a Themed Card, the theme is read out to all the players on both teams.<br/><br/>The Question Master reads out the Red Question to the opposing team. If that team answers correctly they move their piece onto the first Red Space on the board. The same team is then given the White Question, moving their piece onto the White Space if they answer correctly and so on down the card.<br/><br/>If at anytime a question is answered incorrectly then the Question Master can put the same question to the members of their own team for a bonus move. If they answer correctly they move their own piece onto the next space on the board that matches the colour of the question. The original team is always given the first chance to answer each question.

It is of the shogi branch of the chess family but does not involve drops. Set-up is on the back row identical to international chess <i>except</i> that king is placed on the center left column for either player so that kings are not facing each other. Pawn however occupy the third rather than the second row.<br/><br/>For simplicity, I'm using the international chess names of pieces rather than the traditional Japanese names. The king moves one space in any direction but castling does not exist. The queen moves one space in any direction except diagonally backwards. Bishops move either one space diagonally in any direction or one space forward. Knights move only forward in an otherwise normal knight's move so that the piece jumps to a space on either side of the space two rows ahead of its starting position. Rooks move only forward but otherwise like a standard rook. Pawns move only one space forward with no initial two-step move, and all pieces including pawns capture as they move.<br/><br/>The promotion zone is the last three rows on the board for either player. All pieces except the king and queen promote to the queen. Promotion is optional so long as a piece still has a legal move in its non-promoted state. The promotion happens at the end of the move and the move must either begin or end in the promotion zone.<br/><br/>The object is to check-mate the opponent's king. Both bared king and stalemate count as a win, but a bared king becomes a draw if the other player can bare one's king in the next move.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": [], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Ancient"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Heian Shogi", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.816497, "numcomments": 1}, "91671": {"mechanics": ["Betting/Wagering", "Dice Rolling"], "usersrated": 250, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1121031.jpg", "wishing": 52, "owned": 411, "trading": 9, "id": 91671, "yearpublished": 2011, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 21, "wanting": 13, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1121031_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Competo / Marektoy", "Gigamic", "Zoch Verlag"], "families": ["Animals: Worms"], "description": "In the dice game Da ist der Wurm drin, players want to be the first to have their worm poke its head out of the compost heap at the end of the garden.<br/><br/>To set up the game board, attach a smaller game board with two slots in it to the larger game board on which the worms will crawl.

Over the course of several generations, those in power change. Players try to influence succession and match their House's resources to the interests of the True Power in the land (often not the actual monarch). By adding new family branches, using carefully arranged marriages, and managing grants players raise their prestige in the hopes of seizing power after the inevitable downfall of the monarchy.<br/><br/>Basic Play<br/>Each player has a house display representing their larger political family. BRANCHES make up that family, beginning the game with a same number of small family branches. Each branch is represented by a card with a branch name and spaces for GRANTS. Grants represent offices, industries, resources, contacts and so on which that part of the family has control of. There are six kinds of grants: Influence (INFL) which generates the currency for play and the five areas of control: Activism (ACT), Intellectual (INT), Religion (REL), Society (SOC) and Warfare (WAR). Grants, represented by tiles, can move around throughout the game. Some branches may also have special abilities which allow special actions or modify the values of the grants attached to them.<br/><br/>During each turn, players may add a new branch to their House Display. Since they only may have five branches at a time, they will eventually have to Marry or merge two of those houses, creating a new branch. Each turn players gain currency in the form of influence, bid to add a branch, support those in power, and take actions. Some actions can always be taken, while others require the use of particular grant types. At the end of the turn, players check to see which Royal currently holds sway in the realm. Players score VPs based on the interests of that Royal and how well their various branches and grants match those.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Lowell Francis"], "categories": ["Political"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Right of Succession", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 120, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.63636, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 2.26727, "numcomments": 4}, "91683": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Role Playing"], "usersrated": 7, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic943557.jpg", "wishing": 3, "owned": 45, "trading": 0, "id": 91683, "yearpublished": 1988, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 2, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic943557_t.jpg", "publishers": ["FASA"], "families": ["BattleTech"], "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>&quot;Maximilian Liao offered Anton Marik two things: his daughter in marriage and the assassination of Anton's brother, Captain-General Janos Marik.

The small U.S. Regular Army would quickly be joined by tens of thousands of volunteers, who answered the war&rsquo;s signature battle cry &quot;Remember the Maine!&quot; with the less-well-remembered response:<br/><br/>&quot;To Hell with Spain!&quot;<br/><br/>To Hell With Spain is a supplement for the Infantry Attacks series, based on the battles fought in Cuba and Puerto Rico between June and August 1898. It is not a complete game: ownership of any boxed game in the Infantry Attacks series is necessary to provide the rules and markers, and maps are drawn from the following Panzer Grenadier games and supplements: Elsenborn Ridge, Road to Berlin, Battle of the Bulge, Kokoda Trail, Eastern Front and 1940: The Fall of France. There are 10 scenarios, each based on an actual battle or situation from the Spanish-American War.<br/><br/>To Hell With Spain is sold exclusively via .pdf download.

For example, Roman legionaries would have a high UCV due to their better equipment, good leadership, and regular training while barbarian tribesmen would have a lower UCV.<br/><br/>Combat is divided into shooting, impact, and melee. Unit's abilities are divided into strengths and weaknesses in these areas. For example, a barbarian unit may have a high impact value, meaning that they have a formidable first charge, but their value in an ensuing melee is less imposing.<br/><br/>The figure scales used for the game is 1:50 (one model figure representing 50 actual men) and the time scale is one turn equals approximately 60 minutes.

The result is a more intense and nerve-wracking game that takes place over eight turns (from the end of March to mid-April), at least half of which are composed of three operational phases. Both players will face difficult challenges. The German player needs to re-create the historic breakthrough and has to put in every effort to reach Amiens. The Allied player has to resist succumbing to panic in the first turns in order to organize an effective defense, and then a counter-attack near the end of the game.<br/><br/>While the basic rules in Somme 18 are identical to those in Marne 1918 (with the exception of the air rules, which have been completely revised), the advanced rules will be very different. The principal reason is the length of Operation Michael, about fifteen days, which does not give an opportunity for the campaign management rules of Marne 1918 to be used.<br/><br/>So, all of the unit management tracks have disappeared and have been replaced by one table that manages the replacement and re-construction of units. Strategic movement has also been greatly simplified and adapted to the tempo of the game.<br/><br/>Somme 1918 will of course be enriched by numerous specific rules, simulating the particularities of this battle.<br/><br/><br/>     Petain&rsquo;s Reticence: Simulates the French command&rsquo;s lack of urgency in supporting their British allies.<br/>     The arrival of French reinforcements without their artillery support, allowing a quicker deployment of troops coupled with a reduction in their value.<br/>     Inter-Allied Cooperation: This will be extremely reduced at the beginning of the campaign.<br/>     Evolution of the use of Stoss: The doctrine of using assault troops had been principally introduced by General von Hutier, in Russia and Italy. At the beginning of Operation Michael, the generals commanding the Second and Seventeenth armies used their Stosstruppen in frontal assaults, wasting these elite forces and provoking fury from Ludendorff. A rule thus simulates the evolution of this doctrine.<br/>     The Doullens Conference: At the height of the German offensive, while the French Army under Petain prepared to cut its ties with the British, Haig accepted that he be placed under the command of Foch, finally creating an inter-Allied command. This rule simulates this conference, tied to German conquests. It also plays a part in obtaining victory points. In fact, this rule is really the heart of the game and we think that players will be pleased with the proposed system that will bring together the different parameters of this game.<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 3.5, "bayesaverage": 5.64571, "designers": ["Thomas Pouchin", "Nicolas Rident"], "categories": ["Wargame", "World War I"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Somme 1918", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 240, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "4580"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "679"}], "average": 7.86825, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.12868, "numcomments": 36}, "87648": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 4, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic983646.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 8, "trading": 0, "id": 87648, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic983646_t.jpg", "publishers": ["GamesArtBooks"], "families": [], "description": "From the rules:<br/><br/>In the mid 18th century, two fearless pirate brothers ruled the seas of the world as it was then known.

Each has been contrived to show a historic resolution, fun for the English player, depressing for the French. Azincourt (French spelling) is a unique approach. The French might have had more coordinated leadership. They might not have been so intent on an easy victory, and as a result been so careless. They might have taken advantage of the vulnerable English advance. They might have waited for the English to wear themselves out crossing the muddy field and allowed Henry to make the first attack. They might have employed their crossbows to better effect. Had they better control of their troops, crowded conditions would not have reduced combat effectiveness. Finally, had they considered avenues for retreating units, disruption of fresh units would not been such a problem.<br/><br/>In Azincourt I address a number of these what-ifs but, moreover, I offer players the unique mechanic of commanding one flank of each opposing army. In effect players play BOTH the French AND the British. It works out much better than you would expect. Since the English line is necessarily pretty static, there is little problem in coordinating an English defense while splitting command of the French in the face of the enemy mirrors the historically poor French command.<br/><br/>Azincourt is a card assisted, counter and hex game utilizing large colorful counters and a variety of aids that allows for a key battle component which other versions neglect to emphasize - the capture of nobles for ransom. Integral to Azincourt play is the capture of these nobles, English and French (including King Henry), of varying value. Ah and then there are the complications that such nobles bring. Wounded nobles become easy targets. Captured nobles make targets of their captors. Then there are Henry's terrible archers ... who WILL run out of arrows, and then what? To add to the game's variety is a random set-up and reinforcemnt schedule that toys with a number of possible historical possibilities.<br/><br/>Playtesting has been a blast so far but continues so no publisher has yet committed.

The game - even though cynical and satirical - is based in part on the historical facts as outlines by Marcus Tullius Cicero in his famous speech in defense of Sextus Roscius. Even though you can trust Cicero - as lawyer that he was - to illuminate the 'facts' in a specific light, also according to other sources the proscriptions were every bit as bad and corrupt as shown in this game.<br/><br/>Players take the role of Chiefs of Roman gangs from the Aventine Hill during Sulla&rsquo;s reign of terror and proscription of 82BC. On one hand the players are building a reputation for being most daring, bringing proscribed but highly influential Senators or Equites to 'justice' (by chopping of their heads). By this they gain blood money as bounty while also plundering the homes of those unfortunates. Still, some of that money should better find its way back into Crysogonus&rsquo; coffers. The freedman Chrysogonus was Sulla's right-hand man in this and his 'secretarius' meticulously notes down your name and the bounty paid. Chrysogonus does not look favorable on those lacking generosity in their presents. On the other hand, the gangs also raise money by extorting the grain merchants or the red-light district. Player&rsquo;s might also prey on each other in an attempt to rob the other gangs of their ill-gotten wealth either on the way home or by besieging or storming and plundering their lair. But beware Sulla&rsquo;s veterans patrolling the streets and your competitors as bounty hunter, Sulla&rsquo;s freedmen the Sullani. Players use their boss and his three lieutenants, all of them being specialized for different roles, and beef up their gangs by rogues lending numbers, muscles, speed or stealth. Sometimes guile succeeds where brutal force fails. The hulking brute - worth 3 normal men in a fight - might be hard-pressed to blend into the crowd if a patrol of Veterans enters the city quarter. Players might try to bribe officials to influence the Civil War, steer the patrols or 'ameliorate'their records with the 'secretarius' while influencing the proscription lists. They use prophecies by the witch (the 'Stryga') to influence and scare their superstitious opponents. The overall goal is to become the richest and most infamous of all bosses. Still, finally peace will come. Depending on the outcome of the civil war which the players might vigorously try to influence, the Chief having killed the wrong people and the Chief not having parted generously enough with his money, &quot;unfortunately&quot; will be executed.<br/><br/>This will leave only those of the rich and infamous who survived, to finally win the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 3.5, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Hajo Peters"], "categories": ["Ancient", "Fighting", "Political"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Signum Mortis", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 240, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.77083, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.41222, "numcomments": 14}, "83604": {"mechanics": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "usersrated": 5, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic831409.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 26, "trading": 1, "id": 83604, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 2, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic831409_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Wargame Shop"], "families": ["3D Games", "American Civil War in 3D", "Brothers At Arms series"], "description": "1861 - Hoke&rsquo;s Run (American Civil War in 3D)<br/><br/>This absolutely FREE complementary battle in our series of the American Civil Wargames in 3D sees the Union army under General M.G Robert Patterson attempting to defeat the Confederate army of General Joseph E.

Each player has a force composed of a number of Units, each of which in turn includes a number of individual figures, with weapons chosen from a short list of generic weapon types (it's simple to add more or detail the existing ones). A player is allowed to activate his units one at a time until he fails an activation roll, at which time play passes to the opponent. Units which have not moved, or fail to activate, are able to use reaction fire. Movement is measured from a short list of available actions, run, walk, assault, etc. Combat is resolved using a die roll-savings throw mechanic, with saving throws only if the target wears armor. Hits result in Suppression or Casualties, with more experienced units able to take more suppression hits before casualties are inflicted. vehicles are treated generically, but with a choice of armor &amp; weapons.<br/><br/>Force list, weapon choices and vehicle details are left to the player, although fan-produced lists have been posted on the game website.<br/><br/>FUBAR has a range of rules and supplements including these genre:<br/><br/>    FUBAR 40K Boarding Actions - Space Hulk and Space Crusade<br/>    FUBAR Generic Sci-Fi<br/>    FUBAR Stargate1<br/>    FUBAR Star Wars - Hoth battle <br/>    FUBAR Clone Wars<br/>    FUBAR Starship Troopers<br/>    FUBAR Steampunk<br/>    FUBAR Warhammer 40K<br/>    FUBAR Warzone<br/>    FUBAR Hammers Slammers<br/>    FUBAR Imperial Commander<br/>    FUBAR 15mm SciFi<br/>    FUBAR Micro FUBAR - 6mm scale<br/>    FUBAR Vietnam<br/>    FUBAR WW2<br/>    FUBAR Afghanistan<br/>    FUBAR Horror <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.6667, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Craig Cartmell"], "categories": ["Miniatures", "Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "FUBAR", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.17143, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.29178, "numcomments": 7}, "83649": {"mechanics": ["Auction/Bidding", "Hand Management", "Simulation"], "usersrated": 2, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic821358.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 2, "trading": 0, "id": 83649, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic821358_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Web published)", "The Game Crafter, LLC"], "families": [], "description": "DESCRIPTION:<br/>Have you ever wanted to rule the world?

Players begin with their teams of parachuters spread across the tiles that make up the sky over the island.

Movement is complicated by the fact one player may push an adjacent player in the direction of the wind, but may not separate groups of three or four of the opponent's parachuters.

It is a world in permanent war for the control of the territory. Play and become a true Lord of Tierra Mesa by beating your rivals.<br/><br/>AIM OF THE GAME:<br/>The aim of the game is to achieve, before the other players, a combination of 5 cards with the same value, or to form an army with 5 consecutive cards of the same race or where each value accords a different race (Unbeatable Run).<br/><br/>You will become Lord of Table Land in several ways:<br/>1.    Gathering together an army of 5 consecutive cards (run) of the same race.<br/>2.    Gathering together 5 cards of the same value (archers, princesses, catapults&hellip;)<br/>3.    And finally, the Unbeatable Run; you can get an army alliance gathering 5 consecutive cards of a different race each.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who gathers one of these combinations.<br/><br/>BEFORE THE GAME:<br/>-    Shuffle the cards.<br/>-    Hand out 5 cards to each player.<br/>-    Allocate the deck of cards facing down, in the middle of Table Land.<br/>-    The first game starts with the player who owns most hairs in his ears, continuing then, in a clockwise direction. The following games are started by the winner of the previous game.<br/><br/>Once all the cards have been distributed to the players the game stars. The player that starts the game draws one card from the central deck, looks at it, and gets rid of the card which is not convenient for him. Each player should always have 5 cards.<br/><br/>Each player discards should be placed on Table Land, ALWAYS in front of the player, creating a deck where the last discarded card is shown. This way there should be as many discarded decks as players.<br/><br/>When a player gets rid of a card and puts it on its deck facing up, any interested player can take it. How? The interested player should cover it with its hand. The fastest player covering the deck is the one that gets the card. This player should then discard one of his cards. Then, the game continues in a clockwise direction starting from him.<br/><br/>This way the game continues until one of the players gathers 5 cards with the same value or 5 consecutive cards of the same race or the Unbeatable Run. The player should let the other players know during his turn by placing the discard card facing down and by showing his 5 wining cards, he gains the victory by beating his rivals.<br/><br/>WINING COMBINATIONS:<br/><br/>Option 1 &ndash; Whoever wins 5 games is the winner of the whole game.<br/><br/>Option 2 &ndash; After each game all card points must be counted, except those from the winner, being 100 points those from the action cards. The player with fewer points after 5 games is the winner.<br/><br/>Option 3 &ndash; After each game only the winner&rsquo;s points must be counted, in this situation the value (each value corresponds to a different race) of the Unbeatable Run is three times the addition of the values. The game finishes when one of the players reaches 1000 points or a previously agreed quantity.<br/><br/>These are not the only possibilities, players can agree on other options for victory.<br/><br/>ACTION CARDS:<br/><br/>This game has a series of action cards which are used for the interaction between players to threaten their rivals:<br/><br/>Skull (2 cards): If a player places this card on the other player&rsquo;s deck it means that all his troops have been killed. He must place all his cards, facing down, beneath the central deck and draw 5 new cards.<br/><br/>card swap (1 card): If a player places this card in another player&rsquo;s deck, both players must swap one card.<br/><br/>hand swap (1 card): Placing this card in another player&rsquo;s discard deck means that you swap your hand of cards with that player.<br/><br/>steal 2 cards for the deck (2 cards): Placing this card on to other player&rsquo;s discard deck means that the player who has placed the card (the attacking card) randomly takes 2 cards from the other player&rsquo;s hand, and then this player must immediately pick up two new cards from the central deck. The 2 cards that have been taken from the player&rsquo;s hand must be placed beneath the central deck without looking at them.<br/><br/>steal 3 cards for the deck (1 card): Placing this card in another player&rsquo;s discard deck means that the player who has placed the card (the assailant) randomly takes 3 cards from his rival&rsquo;s hand. Then, the rival should draw 3 new cards from the central deck. The cards taken from his hand must be placed beneath the central deck without looking at them.<br/><br/>steal a card (3 cards): Placing this card in another player&rsquo;s discard deck means that the player who has placed the card (the assailant) randomly takes 1 card from his rival&rsquo;s hand, and keeps it. Now the victim has 4 cards, therefore he must pick up a new card to have 5. The assailant has now 6 cards therefore he must discard one of them to have 5 again to continue the battle.<br/><br/>Potion (2 cards): the joker substitutes any other card concerning value and race. It can NOT be used as action card. One player can have on its hand up to two jokers.<br/><br/>FAQs:<br/><br/>- Which discard cards can I pick up? You can only pick up the last card that has been placed at the top of the discard deck from the player that&rsquo;s on its turn.<br/><br/>- After an action card who continues? The player next to the player who has discarded the Action Card, always clockwise.<br/><br/>- Do runs or the Unbeatable Run have to start from number 5? Runs do not have to start from 5, as long as they are always consecutive numbers.<br/><br/>- What should it be done if the extension of Tierra Mesa cannot be cover and a player does not reach their rivals discard decks? Instead of hunting the card with the hand you should scream Guar!!! The one that screams it first takes the card.<br/><br/>- Can I draw one card from any discard deck while other player is drawing a card from the central deck? When a player picks up a card from the central deck the possibility of taking a card from a discard deck is blocked.<br/><br/>- If I take a card from a discard deck, can the card that appears underneath be taken later on? NO. Those cards were previously played, therefore, you should pay attention!!<br/><br/>- What should it be done when the central deck finishes? All discard decks from all the players must be gathered together to form a new central deck. The cards must be shuffle before placing them on the middle of Tierra Mesa.<br/><br/>- If two players place their hands on a discard deck, who takes the card? Either the one that has more fingers placed on it, or the most aggressive one.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "bayesaverage": 5.48032, "designers": ["Jorge Pi\u00f1an", "Ignacio S\u00e1nchez Usera"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Fantasy", "Party Game"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "GUAR Fantasy", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 20, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "11645"}], "average": 5.25161, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 2.02865, "numcomments": 9}, "87749": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "usersrated": 1, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic858260.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 87749, "yearpublished": 2006, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic858260_t.jpg", "publishers": ["\u041e\u041e\u041e \"\u0422\u0435\u0445\u043d\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\""], "families": [], "description": "Black Gold is a modern warfare wargame with strategic elements.<br/>Players seek to control the oil fields, and destroy opposing enemy units.

All over the world, the railway networks were growing and steam engines accelerated the progress. 175 years ago, on December 7 1835 to be precise, the first German train powered by a steam engine started operating between Nuremberg and F&uuml;rth, transporting passengers and goods. In England&rsquo;s region of Wensleydale transport of goods via railway tracks was started 13 years later.<br/> First Train to Nuremberg is a revised edition of Last Train to Wensleydale. You take the role of a railway promoter, backed by the investments of hundreds of local landowners. Your aim is to build lines that can make a profit from the transport of passengers and goods. However, money is not the only resource you require. Many locals will oppose your schemes and only with influence in the government will you be able to build over their land. Your company is far too small to be able to have its own engine works, so contacts with the major operators will help you acquire second-hand trains and rolling stock. You will also need to be on good terms with the two local railway companies. Without their support you will not be able to link to their networks, nor will you be able to negotiate the sale of your lines when they become unprofitable (as they surely will).<br/><br/>With First Train to Nuremberg now two players can fully enjoy this extraordinary train game as well. Instead of cheese and stone, now beer and mail will be transported, besides passengers of course. There is a new challenge when transporting passengers: They can travel first class now and thus you will gain more victory points but on the other hand, you have to buy trains that are more  expensive. Additionally, you may benefit from the first connection between Nuremberg and F&uuml;rth and receive extra victory points, which may be crucial for winning the game. What&rsquo;s more, you may play the original game of Last Train to Wensleydale on the flip side of the game board, or almost so. Some slight changes of the original rules work with that map as well as the rules of the first edition.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 3.2048, "bayesaverage": 6.33158, "designers": ["Martin Wallace"], "categories": ["Trains", "Transportation"], "name": "First Train to Nuremberg", "playingtime": 120, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "1108"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "538"}], "average": 7.16657, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.21509, "numcomments": 351}, "89722": {"mechanics": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "usersrated": 2, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic902469.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 3, "trading": 0, "id": 89722, "yearpublished": 1982, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic902469_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Simulations Cornejo"], "families": [], "description": "A wargame in French published in 1982.<br/><br/>It's about the general Patton and the 3rd US army liberating Metz on the way to attack the Saarland.<br/><br/>It's a small scale little wargame with hex and counters.

Finnish infantry assaults the board 10 and 42 villages attempting to capture buildings against infantry, guns and tanks.<br/><br/>FE 64 The Iron Ring is Closed, August 1941: This is a very meaty scenario. 44 German squads, OBA, halftracks and assault guns attack on boards 40, 49, 42, 24, 22 and 23. The Russians defend with 42 squads and several guns. The victory conditions are interesting with each side attempting to control the riverbank.<br/><br/>FE 65 Straight to the Front, September 1941: This scenario offers some good replay value. The Germans attack across boards 19 and 11 attempting to capture some buildings. The Germans get SS infantry and some AFV. The Russians start with some infantry and receive random tank support. A medium sized scenario should be popular.<br/><br/>FE 66 Tedium, October 1941: This is a classic slogging match across boards 19 and 44. Dug-In Russian troops try to stop a combined arms German force. The Germans have infantry, tanks and halftracks against the Russians with infantry, fortifications and Guns.<br/><br/>FE 67 A Cold Day in Hell, December 1941: The Finns and the Russians go at it in this small infantry only action. The action takes place in winter conditions on boards 8 and 42. This should make for good tourney action.<br/><br/>FE 68 Beast of Prey, March 1942: A real and true slugfest in the woods. Once again dug-in Russian defenders on boards 32 and 36 try to hold Germans from exiting the board. The Russians get infantry, fortifications and Guns while the Germans get SS infantry and some Stugs.<br/><br/>FE 69 Tiger Woods, August 1942: Yes! Another scenario with Tiger in its title!!! If that is not enough to get you excited then this scenario's OB should do it. The Germans get 4 Tigers up against a couple of Russian T-43's and a AA Truck. Each side gets a good number of infantry. This action takes place on boards 36 and 42.<br/><br/>FE 70 Worker's Settlement No. 8, September 1942: This cool infantry only scenario (well the Germans get one INF gun) takes place on board 33 and 4. This scenario has a cool twist for entry conditions with the Russians entering anywhere on 3 board edges. A cool twist in the VC makes for some uncertainty on where to attack. Sure to be a favorite for the tourney crowd.<br/><br/>FE 71 Cold Steel Rain, January 1943: This is another meaty scenario that should offer some good replay value given the variable VC. The Germans get infantry and some AT Guns and defend on boards 33 and 48 against attacking Russian infantry, OBA and some T-60 tanks. .<br/><br/>FE 72 Manos a la Manos, February 1943: The Spanish Blue Division makes its debut in this action on boards 13 and 18. The Spanish infantry with an AT Gun and some variable additional forces must defend some terrain against a lot of Russian infantry, tanks and Flamethrower tanks. The Russians got the numbers but do they have the time to capture the victory terrain?!<br/><br/>FE 73 Polar Star, February 1943: Another meaty old-fashioned scenario, this time on boards 17, 19 and 18. The Germans get 24 squads, fortifications, Stugs and some AT Guns and must hold off a swarm of 32 Russian squads, Assault guns and tanks from exiting and capturing some buildings. Lots of options in this one fore each side.<br/><br/>FE 74 Fruitless Fighting, March 1943: The classic capture the village type scenario on boards 12 and 17. This scenario features 20 Russian squads supported by tanks and assault guns attacking the village against an outpost of SS infantry and some fortifications. The Germans receive reinforcements in the form of infantry and 4 Tiger tanks.<br/><br/>FE 75 Porech'e Push, August 1943: My favorite of the scenarios in this pack. The Russians fight out of a bridgehead against a strong German force to capture the hills overlooking their bridgehead. Really get the flavor of the historic action in this one. The Russians get a bunch of infantry and an assortment of AFV against German infantry, guns and additional forces that they select from an available force pool. This scenario is set on boards 3, 8 and 49.<br/><br/>FE 76 The Battle of Krasnogvadeisk, January 1944: This is another one of those big scenarios that capture the flavor of east front action. Set on boards 18, 49 and 22 this is a meaty scenario with 26 Russian squads and 5 AFV attacking to capture some buildings against 21 squads, 4 tanks and some fortifications.<br/><br/>FE 77 Stalin's Revenge, June 1944: Another Finnish versus Russian scenario setup on boards 5 and 32. This is a smallish scenario featuring 9 Finnish squads and a couple of AT Guns against 15 Russian squads and 3 AFV. This is a brutal one for the Finnish as they attempt to stop the Russians from capturing some buildings.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 0, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Paul Kenny"], "categories": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Fighting", "Wargame", "World War II"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Leningrad Pack", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 6.5, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.5, "numcomments": 2}, "85985": {"mechanics": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Partnerships", "Variable Player Powers"], "usersrated": 3, "image": "", "wishing": 13, "owned": 25, "trading": 0, "id": 85985, "yearpublished": 1986, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 5, "thumbnail": "", "publishers": ["DTI (Diverse Talents, Incorporated)"], "families": ["Dune"], "description": "A set of 8 new Dune Treachery cards printed on 1 sheet of cardstock with 2 pages of accompanying rules.

In The Body Snatchers the players are secretly taking on the roles as Pod People and Humans to either fight to absorb the world or to save it from being utterly vanquished. In turns the players will choose one of the characters on the board to move around the city of Santa Mira and perform a number of available actions that are accessible at the different locations. The Pod People seek to infiltrate the city and must do so by secretly assigning Influence cards from their hand to the different locations.<br/><br/>The Humans play in the same fashion but as they will be outnumbered and seek to sabotage the invasion, they must try to assigning as low Influence as they possibly can without raising too much suspicion on their part. If they're not detected and manage to hinder the aliens from influencing more than half of the city within one week they have succeeded. But if the city has been overrun by then the world shall never wake up again.<br/><br/>&quot;The seed is planted... now terror grows.&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Tobias S\u00f6lvefjord"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Deduction", "Print & Play"], "name": {"@sortindex": "5", "#text": "The Body Snatchers", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 20, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "87802": {"mechanics": ["Pattern Building"], "usersrated": 11, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic864192.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 13, "trading": 1, "id": 87802, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic864192_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Alga", "RSV Productions Inc."], "families": [], "description": "From the Web site, <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.scrublecube.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.scrublecube.com/</a><br/><br/><font color=#2121A4><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>If you can spell you can play ... SCRUBLE Cube!<br/><br/>What if you took some of the known playing patterns of some of the most popular word games and puzzles in history and combined them in a brand new, unique format to create the World&rsquo;s Greatest 3-D Word Game?  Well, you&rsquo;d have the SCRUBLE Cube, a patent pending game with over 7.4 x 10^45 (that&rsquo;s 7,401 septillion)  possible configurations that anyone who can spell can play. And all in a portable format that can be played anywhere -- anytime. The SCRUBLE Cube is a word game and a puzzle -- on steroids!</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Scruble Cube consists of a 4x4x4 Rubik's Cube, except a letter (along with the letter's point value) appears on each exposed side of each sub-cube. These letters are attached on circular pegs that freely rotate. This enables you to rotate each letter so that you can spell words in any direction.<br/><br/>Players have 90 seconds manipulate the cube to form a word in a straight line that may wrap around the cube. Other sub-cube faces have Scrabble-type point modifiers such as double letter score or tripe word score. You get to use these point modifiers if they appear at the beginning or end of your word. A variant allows you to use these modifiers to represent any letter. Players also score bonuses if their word covers more than one face and if it intersects a previously created word (and that word still appears on the cube).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": [], "categories": ["Puzzle", "Word Game"], "name": "Alfapet Twist", "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 3.72727, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.48268, "numcomments": 4}, "83707": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Paper-and-Pencil", "Set Collection"], "usersrated": 4, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic933930.jpg", "wishing": 14, "owned": 10, "trading": 0, "id": 83707, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 1, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic933930_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Self-Published)"], "families": ["Wine Games"], "description": "A  print-and-play dice (and resource management) game of making wine.

During this time Solomon instituted an unprecedented building program. As one of Solomon's chief governors, you must procure materials and oversee construction of buildings and roads across the land for the glory of Solomon. You will also help to construct the Temple, one of the wonders of the ancient world.<br/><br/>Kingdom of Solomon is a worker-placement game with a few new twists and turns. Do you claim a resource space, an action space or throw in all your remaining pawns to grab a powerful Bonus Space? Will you spend your resources to extend Solomon's kingdom, take some points in the Market or add to the Temple? These and many other choices await you in this highly interactive game.<br/><br/>You play Kingdom of Solomon in rounds of four phases.  You start the round placing your pawns to get resources, take actions or get a bonus.  In this placement phase players take turns, each placing one pawn at a time.  After all pawns have been placed, players resolve what they get from placing their pawns.  This is called the resolution phase, and each player, in turn, resolves the placement of all their pawns before the next player.  Next the players can go to the Market to sell or buy resources.  In this market phase, like the placement phase, players alternate taking turns, except that players take turns in reverse order.  The last shall be first, and the first shall be last.  Finally, you build in the building phase.  Players, one at a time, can build a building, roads and add blocks to the Temple.<br/>  <br/>When you place pawns to take actions, you can get an additional resource for a resource space, trade one resource for another, steal a resource from an opponent, get victory points or draw Fortune cards.  You can play Fortune cards at any time.  Fortune cards provide resources, victory points or special actions.  Bonuses your pawns can gain for you include one of every resource, three Fortune cards or victory points with a rearrangement of turn order so you become the new first player.<br/><br/>You use resources to build things.  Each thing costs a specific set of resources.  The buildings you build give you victory points and additional spots to place pawns for resources or actions.  Roads link resource spaces into resource regions so you can get more resources per pawn placed in the resource region.  Building Temple blocks give you either victory points or temple tokens that help you gain or keep the High Priest.  The High Priest lets you take advantage of another player&rsquo;s resource region and gives you victory points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game ends at the end the round when a player places all his building tokens on building sites, there is a building token on each of the building sites, or the Temple is complete.

The management of the Chamber of Screams decided to reward the employees with a mini-Halloween celebration held during normal business hours in the employee break room. The Haunted House typically shut down each night for a brief time period so the employees could get a break and straighten up their haunted scenes. It was rumored that management probably did this so the line of customers outside would build up and The Chamber of Screams would look twice as popular. Regardless of the reason for the break, the employees looked forward to the upcoming treat during their next shift at work. The Halloween Celebration kicked off without a hitch as the frightening cast members piled into the employee break area and enjoyed delicious creepy appetizers and eerie drinks while quizzing each other on challenging spooky trivia. They played a few hilarious games such as So You Think You Can Dance, the Creepy Disguise Challenge and the Horrific Rap Contest and then mingled about as they caught up on the latest gossip about the haunted house employees. A delicious dinner was served while the celebrators played the amusing Marvelous Movie Challenge. After dinner, some of the cast members engaged in the Writers, Producers, Directors and Actors challenge as a select few filtered back towards their scary scenes in the haunted house to get ready for the reopen. Unexpectedly, the lights went out and within a few minutes...to everyone's horror...a dead body was discovered! The employees scrambled to figure out whodunit before the police arrived. During the intense investigation, the employees took a break from the stress of it all and had a blast with the What Scary Thing Am I game and the Boisterous Balloon Battle. One of the cast members called in a quick favor from a police officer that quickly lifted fingerprints off the murder weapon so the investigators could be sure of their opinions of whodunit. Once everyone was ready, they took turns accusing who they believed the murderer was. Then, one by one, each person confessed to their involvement, if any, and the murder confessed! After a crazy escape attempt, the employees topped off their Halloween Celebration with the Happy Halloween Memory Game, the Chamber of Screams Charades and the Frightening Film Festival. Overall, it was a night at the Chamber of Screams that absolutely nobody will ever forget!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 8, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": [], "categories": ["Murder/Mystery", "Party Game"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Homicide On Halloween at the Chamber of Screams Haunted House", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 240, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "83741": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Variable Player Powers"], "usersrated": 30, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic814382.jpg", "wishing": 9, "owned": 131, "trading": 14, "id": 83741, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 3, "wanting": 3, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic814382_t.jpg", "publishers": ["RealmsMasters Game Forge"], "families": [], "description": "From the Publisher:<br/><br/>The Virus, ever changing, has spread like a plague, holding the Isle hostage within its deathly grip.

The day of the feast arrived and the hungry guests flocked to the Standish home with their hands full of tasty dishes to be shared by all. The guests quizzed each other with fun trivia while nibbling on delectable appetizers. To everyone's surprise, representatives from a neighboring flock of wild turkeys also arrived on the scene to befriend the Pilgrims and Native Americans in hopes to stop the growing tradition of roasting a turkey on Thanksgiving Day. The turkey representatives gave it their best shot and pleaded with the humans to make a switch of the traditional Thanksgiving feast to cow, pig or maybe even fish as the main course. After the humans listened to the wild turkey&rsquo;s pleas, they decided to give the turkeys 'temporary immunity' while they engaged in a fun game of 'What Thanksgiving Thing am I.' They continued with the challenging 'Football Mascot Challenge' before settling in for a nice Thanksgiving Dinner. But before they could dig into the Thanksgiving feast, a victim was discovered in the adjacent room! Murder on Thanksgiving?! Disastrous! The group rallied together to investigate whodunit before the murderer could get away! They took a quick break from the stress of the investigation and played some awesome games such as the 'Thanksgiving Scramble Challenge', 'Thanksgiving Bingo' and the hilarious 'So You Wanna Make a Turkey' challenge. Then, the guests one by one accused who they believed the murderer was and then to everyone's shock...the murderer confessed! The guests capped off the investigation with a hilarious game of 'Thanksgiving Charades' followed by a challenging 'Thanksgiving Word Hunt' game and then settled in for a delectable Thanksgiving feast!

ShadowSea adds an expanded magic system, equipment rules, rules for resolving non-combat actions, and new special abilities to the basic Song of Blades and Heroes rules.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Eric Louchard", "Andrea Sfiligoi"], "categories": ["Fantasy", "Miniatures", "Print & Play", "Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "ShadowSea", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 45, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.8375, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.714033, "numcomments": 3}, "87861": {"mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Trick-taking"], "usersrated": 13, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic888405.jpg", "wishing": 4, "owned": 36, "trading": 1, "id": 87861, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 2, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic888405_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Mattel"], "families": ["Climbing Games", "Skip-Bo"], "description": "Skip-Bo Breakers imports Climbing Games concepts into the Skip-Bo brand, familiar to the U.S. market.

Though the board itself is only about half the size of your average game, it&rsquo;s actually a brilliantly colored fold-up printed on super sturdy laminated stock that appears perfectly capable of standing up to multiple years&rsquo; worth of play sessions. The same can be said for the game&rsquo;s Move Cards which, while not quite as brawny as most CCG cards, are thick enough to get the job done.<br/><br/>Gameplay is fairly simple and properly reflects the spirit of the source materials - players take the role of one of five Goonies (Mikey, Data, Mouth, Chunk or Andy) and use a three-card hand in an attempt to escape One-Eyed Willy&rsquo;s cave. Players disarm traps to collect Gold Doubloons, and the first to reach the &quot;Escape&quot; square with three such Doubloons wins the game. The process is complicated by a trio of tricky Skull Spaces (only one of which contains the necessary key) that must be passed to reach the exit. This is balanced out by a fun selection of Special Move Cards that allow players to switch places with or steal gold from opponents.

Mankind is upsetting this balance to dangerous levels.<br/><br/>Learn, have fun with friends and family, share this knowledge and make a difference in this world.<br/><br/>What is Sea Ranger?<br/><br/>Sea Ranger is a board game designed to educate and entertain 2-6 players about the amazing and diverse wildlife that inhabits the oceans and waterways creating a giant circle of life.  We can also learn how mankind uses and abuses this incredible resource we all share.<br/><br/>Sea Ranger is a multi-facetted game.  Not only are the players learning about the aquatic environment, they are also learning about themselves.  Players learn many qualities of character that are required to either win or prevent collective loss among the players.  They share the responsibilities, successes and benefits.<br/><br/>Players learn:;<br/><br/>To share and care for resources.<br/><br/>Collective and individual responsibility.<br/><br/>Manage resources.<br/><br/>To maintain a balance of life and needs.<br/><br/>Value life in all forms as part of the wealth of this world.<br/><br/>Respect each players participation and support.<br/><br/>The best part is that it is fun doing this.<br/><br/>Who Can Play?<br/><br/>The game is aimed at children from 8 years and over and adults.  Children will require guidance to assemble.<br/><br/>Children quickly master the rules.<br/><br/>So how does it all work?<br/><br/>The game gives players knowledge and choices.  Players can easily discern what feels right or is the right thing to do.  We all know within our hearts what is right and good, even if we don't know the answer.<br/><br/>The game uses a special board and tokens.  You print out the board and pieces on your colour printer, then cut and assemble the components.  To make them last longer or be more durable you may mount them on card or laminate the pieces.  Teach the children skills as they read instructions and learn to cut out the pieces.<br/><br/>The game is directed by a special card deck which will present players with a series of events and choices.  The players must decide how they will resolve these, sometimes this may require teamwork and sharing.  There are many different strategies you can use to win, some can be very quick, others slower.<br/><br/>Part of the game revolves around maintaining the circle of life, ensuring a balance of species to enable life to continue.  Each creature is part of that circle and has a unique role to play.<br/><br/>Players must then try and balance mankind's intervention and damage to the seas and waterways.  It is a careful juggling act; players individually cannot hope to keep the balance so you need to play cooperatively.<br/><br/>What Do I Get?<br/><br/>Sea Ranger is 26-page colour PDF plus a small rules booklet.   The game requires you to print 16-pages to create the board, cards &amp; tokens.  Included is the deluxe card set giving you the choice of finish.  Where possible we have tried to minimise the graphical content to save ink.  Ideally the major components are printed on card.

With them, they can gather and spread more energy into the world. Furthermore, at the end of the game, the most powerful kami wins, that is to say, the player who gained the biggest number of shintai - or cards.<br/><br/>By playing counters on the map of Japan, the players will spread the vital energy to the terrestrial world. Each city that is attained brings extra cards to the players and unlock new cards. The game actually finishes when the all the map of Japan is covered with counters. However, the players fail their mission if they finish the stack of cards before that point.<br/><br/>By playing counters on the Yin Yang, the players enter the celestial world and challenge the dark powers, which may be helpful to restore the balance of power if counters are scarce. The Yin Yang is a secondary board inside the game box, which contains an ultraviolet lamp : when turned on, this lamp reveals the symbol of a moon on the counters, which was invisible before.

One player directs the Axis forces and must resist Allied pressure for as long as possible while the other directs the Soviets and the Western Allies and must wipe out Nazi Germany and its satellites before the end of the game. The simulation begins in June 1944 with the Normandy landings, the fall of Rome in Italy and Operation Bagration in the east.

It takes roughly 30 minutes to play.<br/><br/>The basic idea is that players are exploring an archipelago in search of islands. The game board consists of a 9&times;9 array of 81 squares, further divided into nine 3&times;3 boxes. There are 18 islands total, but these islands aren&rsquo;t distributed randomly; instead, they are arranged so that two islands occupy each 3&times;3 box, each row, and each column.  What's more, these islands are initially hidden from view.<br/><br/>Players claim one square per turn.  A player either places an island of her color in the region (if there's an island there) or a boat of her color in the region (if there isn't).  Players are trying first to discover and then to connect together as many islands as they can:  the more islands they connect together, the more points they receive at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Players use logic to determine where the islands are likely to be, but logic alone is not enough:  players must also think tactically and strategically in order both to foster their own growth and limit the growth of their opponents.<br/><br/>ScatterLand takes no more than five minutes to learn (or to teach), but its gameplay is surprisingly deep.  There are a lot of things to try to balance when deciding where to play:  do you want to claim a new island as your own or try to connect two of your islands together?  Do you want to try to consolidate your own position or be the first to explore a given area? Do you want to focus on expanding your chains or trying to cut off your opponents?<br/><br/>Two versions of the game are included:  the basic version (described above) and the advanced version (which limits the number of exclusive islands any one player can claim).<br/><br/>ScatterLand can be found at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://boardgameforge.wordpress.com/scatterland/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://boardgameforge.wordpress.com/scatterland/</a> -- just click the links toward the bottom of the page for both the rules and 20 additional boards.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Dan Moran", "Dave Ross"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Exploration", "Print & Play", "Territory Building"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "ScatterLand", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.5, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 3}, "83978": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Variable Player Powers"], "usersrated": 1, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic825666.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 83978, "yearpublished": 2001, "maxplayers": 12, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic825666_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Stratagem Publications LTD"], "families": ["Magazine: Wargames Illustrated"], "description": "From the Introduction<br/><br/>&quot;This set of rules allows you and a few mates to go rummaging around in old ruins looking for sacred texts, the Hair Lip of St. Ravell, treasures of a lost age or just about anything else you fancy.

With this new set of wargames rules, players can take on the role of these warlords and command their own armies on the tabletop. Written by the author of the popular Glutter of Ravens rules set, Dux Bellorum is an element-based system, where each base of figures represents 50 fighting men. Each player has a specific number of points with which to construct his force and can choose to a Late Roman, Romano-British, Welsh, Saxon, Pictish, Irish, or Sea Raider army. The game is then played out following a set of simple, fast-paced rules. A completely self-contained gaming system, Dux Bellorum is perfect for gamers who are looking for a way into fighting Dark Age battles without investing a lot of time or money in larger rulesets.<br/><br/>From the playtest introduction:<br/><br/>Dux Bellorum is an Arthurian-era Dark Ages wargame, set in the period from the mid fourth century AD to the end of the eighth century AD. The rules emphasise the influence an army&rsquo;s commander has on his units, with simple manoeuvre rules and chaotic, swirling close combat. You'll win by inspiring the right troops at the right time, balancing quality versus quantity in your army, and by finding a sprinkling of luck at the right time.<br/><br/>All distances are given in Base Widths, which allows the game to be used with any scale of miniature based in many different ways.

Yes there is, but it's all Good...<br/><br/>Unlike the heavily stat-based games that you see everywhere nowadays, Good: the battle turns these statistics  into two basic attributes; Good and bad. Obviously the better you are at things (shooting, close combat, healing, etc.) the longer you will survive in this world, but everyone has a limit of how much Good they can do. Nasty things like damage, curses, etc can only be described as Bad things, but sometimes a bit of bad is exactly what is needed.<br/><br/>There are thousands, probably hundreds of thousands, of character miniature manufacturers out there; and every single one of these can be used in Good: the Battle - regardless of scale, setting, period, race, etc. Good: the Battle uses the actual miniature to give you benefits in the game. For example; a miniature equipped with swords will be better in close combat, than somebody with none. A miniature carrying a rocket launcher will obviously do more damage if it shoots you in the head. Huge dragons will have more hit points, and mice will have less.

Those not commanded by players become factions available for alliance, along with the Gros Blancs, the Petits Blancs, the Spanish, the French, and the English, each provides the controlling player with a special ability. Alliances are fluid, as is the allegiance of the very units under your command. The more of the island's economy a player controls the more havoc he can cause with the funds he collects. On the other hand, the player who carries the least influence automatically controls the Petits Blancs and no matter how weak a player is, he can always attack a stronger player's economic base.<br/><br/>Black Eagles is no longer in its infancy. Play testing has proven it to be well worthwhile. Scenario play ranges from 90 minutes to four hours. Components include a 22&quot; by 34&quot; map, 45 card events that affect play in various turn phases  --cards also provide resolution for the devastating Yellow Fever.

At certain points on the track, players have the opportunity to pay points to take a shorter route.<br/>The winner is the first player to make a complete circuit of the track and return to the start space with 1500 points or more. Players who complete the track with fewer than 1500 points must go back to an earlier square and try to accumulate more points.<br/><br/>Game 2 (Guess, Who Am I?) - Players roll a die and move along a track collecting pieces of three separate puzzles. Most of the spaces on the board are marked with a statement associated with one of the three &quot;role models&quot; - Parents, Dadashri and Humanity. When landing on a space on the board, players must identify which role model is associated with the statement on that space (example: Space #17 &quot;We should bow down to them every day&quot; is associated with Parents). Correctly identifying the role model allows the player to take the puzzle piece associated with that space. <br/>Other spaces give the player a free random puzzle piece, allow the player to take a piece from another player, or cause the player to lose a turn. Players who reach the end of the track without winning the game move back to Start and continue to collect puzzle pieces.<br/>To win, a player must collect all 12 pieces of one of the three puzzles.

The basic idea is that there is a battle to control and capture a starship by a boarding party moving down the corridors and rooms of the ship. One side controls the attackers, who are mostly composed of the eponymous 'Starship Marines', and the defenders, usually less well armed crewmen, with perhaps a smattering of Marines to stiffen the defense. The deck plans can either be drawn out or built in 3D, depending on your preferences and time available. The scale of toy soldier is 25mm or 1/72, and any make of figures can be used [...]<br/><br/>The minimum you need are a few toy soldiers, some dice, a large sheet of paper with a deck plan on it, and the rules. A typical small game takes about a hour or so (longer if you like arguing about rules).

The German armies in France had ceased being organized formations and were streaming back to the Reich in willy nilly fashion, hotly pursued by the Western Allied armies as they dashed through Paris and to the borders of Germany. The First US Army (with the Ninth later on), hit the Westwall on September 12th and was destined to slog through the mud and rain for months against the fortifications and surprisingly resilient German reserves hurriedly thrown against them in a desperate bid to keep the American army off as much German soil as possible. Additionally, lack of supply served to further restrain the American advance. Would the war be over by Christmas, or would the Germans pull off a second &ldquo;Miracle of the Marne&rdquo; and hold long enough to launch a counteroffensive in the west ?<br/><br/><br/>(from Decision Games website:)<br/><br/>HURTGEN: Hell&rsquo;s Forest is a grand-tactical simulation of that enormous campaign. The 2,240 counters in the game represent almost every formation, at company and battalion levels, which fought in the battle, including US, German, British, and even Belgian units. Infantry, armor, anti-tank, reconnaissance, engineer, assault gun, howitzer, rocket, parachute, ranger, glider, and headquarters units are all fully represented in the counter-mix. The two map sections are an accurate representation of the battle area and were compiled from 1944 German staff maps and 1943-1944 US Army map sources. The area portrayed shows all primary and secondary roads, trails and other types of terrain in relation to their suitability for armor and infantry, along with all the villages, towns and  cities that proved to be the bastions of the German defense, as well as every creek and river that couldn't be crossed by wheeled vehicles without a bridge.<br/><br/>THERE are three main scenarios representing each of the offensive periods of September, October and November. A smaller learning scenario depicts the US 28th Infantry Division&rsquo;s ordeal as it attempted to drive on the Roer River dams through the forest of the area. Players may also play continuously from September to the first week of December (almost 300 game turns!). The big challenge for the allied player is to see if he can reach the Rhine River months ahead of the actual date, and shorten the war considerably. Extensive supply, weather and air power rules are included.<br/><br/>THIS latest edition of the Grand Operational Simulation Series (which began with Wacht am Rhein) presents further refinements to the combat, artillery and supply subsystems in order to better depict tactical and operational warfare at this scale. For example, rules for &ldquo;Lull&rdquo; periods have been added in order to allow players to speed up game play during periods of relative inactivity. These Lulls compress game play from three turns per day to one, allowing players to cover longer intervals of historic time. Other additions feature level-two entrenchments that allow the German player to create fortified bastions in German towns and cities that can better withstand Allied barrages and ground assaults, along with rules that represent the logistical nightmare faced by the Americans during much of the battle.<br/><br/>THE orders of battle have been extensively researched in order to provide an accurate and functional depiction of the armies of both sides. The incredibly hodge podge nature of the resurrecting German army is shown through the depiction of the various rear area units and replacement army battalions that appear almost randomly throughout the game.<br/><br/>GAME SCALE<br/>&bull; Map: 1 mile per hex<br/>&bull; Time: 3 Game Turns per day<br/>&bull; Units: Infantry and Artillery are battalions.

The first player to score 1,000 or more points wins the game! The game has a strategy component where players may trap other players in the cabin, preventing them from scoring.<br/><br/>Special scoring situations have easily recognizable winter themed monikers. Players encounter obstacles along the way in the form of certain types of die rolls (&quot;squalls,&quot; &quot;thaws,&quot; &quot;broken chairlifts&quot;) which may end their turn or put them in the cabin. In addition to obstacles there are special die rolls that immediately reward a player such as &quot;vacations&quot; and &quot;chairlifts&quot;.<br/><br/>Setup<br/>Cabin Fever is designed for 2-8 players with an optimal number of 3 or more players. A game can be played with more than 8 players at the consequence of extending the game's duration. All that is needed in addition to the game is a pad of paper and a pencil or pen with which to keep score.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Each player rolls a single die to determine who starts the game. The highest roll goes first (after resolving ties). All players are considered &ldquo;snowed in&rdquo; and must &quot;dig out&quot; by rolling 100 points or more on the scoring dice. Once a player digs out he or she ends his or her turn and passes the scoring dice to the next player on the left (clockwise) and may begin scoring on his or her next turn.

Players start a turn by rolling all five dice (opening roll) in an attempt to create matching die faces. Players may elect to end their turn at any time and collect their points (with a minimum requirement of a matching pair). Players may continue a turn to earn more points but must roll at least one match to an existing match, or create a new matching set on each consecutive re-roll of non-matching dice. Dice that have been assigned to a match may not be re-rolled.

(A printable 2D version of the board is provided, with coordinate numbers in each square.) This printable gameboard is laid out as a 4x4 arrangement of 16 &quot;levels&quot;, each level being a 4x4 2D chessboard. Alternatively, 4 3D 4x4x4 gameboards set up in a row are usable. The game is available on Zillions, in a version by L Lynn Smith.<br/><br/>Piece moves are translated as directly as possible from 2D to 4D, with some adaptations for play balance. So a rook now can move not only north-south and east-west, but up-down and side to side, too, for a maximum of 8 possible directions. Bishops move diagonally within each level, and may also move diagonally from level to level, which simplifies the move somewhat, changing the bishop from a fully 4D piece to one that is 2D+2D. This change makes the game much easier to play.<br/><br/>The knight, on the other hand, rivals the queen in power, because it is the only piece in chess that already moves in 2 dimensions. On a 4x4x4x4 board, it can reach up to 2 dozen spots. The queen combines the moves of rook and bishop, and the king is a one-square queen in movement.<br/><br/>Pawns are the most changed, moving 1 square &quot;forward&quot; or &quot;sideways&quot; - 6 locations in all, and capturing as it moves. This allows 2 pawns to support each other, a useful feature on <br/>a 4D board.<br/><br/>The game is won by checkmate, which with the held king rule, can be achieved in the standard fashion, or it can be forced on a bare king by a king and 2 major pieces, from any legal positions on the board. The held king rule allows a king moving onto the other king's current &quot;level&quot; to pin the enemy king in that level.

Are we playing ships captains or fleet admirals? In general naval wargamers tend to assume the role of admirals whilst demanding a level of detail more appropriate to a 'game of captains.' For most periods this isn't too much of a problem as the numbers of ships tends to be relatively small, and there are fleet level rules with appropriate levels of abstraction for most periods. However, ancient naval warfare seems to be one period where all available rules operate at the ship level. Obviously this makes battles such as Salamis, with hundreds of ships involved, difficult to handle. I wanted a set of rules that could be used to recreate these enormous battles whilst placing the placing the players truly in the roles of admirals and squadron commanders. At this level the fate of the individual ships, other than those on which the commanders themselves are embarked, is unimportant. Hence, &quot;Greek Fire and Roman Fury&quot; was born.<br/><br/>&quot;The basis for these rules is a theory that the naval battles of antiquity were fought in a style that was essentially similar to typical land actions. Therefore, in these rules, the respective fleets are represented by squadrons rather than individual ships, which are maneuvered around the 'battlefield' in a similar manner to armies. After a few false starts I decided to use the ever popular and quite robust American Civil War Fire and Fury as the basis for the system, hence the name I finally selected for this article.&quot;<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>This miniatures rules set comes with information on what sorts of figures to use, and explains fleet composition, ship data (for the various sorts of ships that appear in the game), formations, sequence of play, morale, and a small number of charts<br/><br/>Rules set appears in Wargames Illustrated #187 (April 2003)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["David Manley"], "categories": ["Ancient", "Miniatures", "Nautical", "Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Greek Fire and Roman Fury", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 240, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "84138": {"mechanics": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Dice Rolling", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic825554.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 84138, "yearpublished": 2003, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic825554_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Stratagem Publications LTD"], "families": ["Magazine: Wargames Illustrated"], "description": "From the Introduction<br/><br/>&quot;Once Hannibal had been defeated at Zama in 202 BC, Rome was clear to concentrate on securing and expanding its eastern frontier beyond the Adriatic.

The system takes away from Second World War and goes to Ancients. In 264 Roma was summoned to Messina by Mamertines mercenaries to help in their quarrel with Cartage, the main power in Sicily. Carthaginians count on Hiero the Tirant of Syracuse to help defeating the Mamertines. Here begins the First Punic War.<br/>Romans and Carthaginians fought for 22 year over Sicily and in North Africa. Rome emerged victorious and Cartage was obliged to quit his long standing presence in Sicily.<br/>The land campaign was a long string of Roman victories as city after city was subdued and every Carthaginian army was defeated in battle. Syracuse was forced to make an alliance with Rome and Cartage was left with only a few fortresses in the island.<br/>Anyway the war was won and lost in the sea. The war saw the emergence of Rome as a sea-power and a long string of naval victories allow Roman troops to menace even Cartage proper. Only to be saved by Xantipus and his mercenary army at the Bagradas Plains battle. Naval warfare played a prominent role in this war and will give Carthage Senate his las blow. Carthage tried to spend the Roman effort during the whole war. His strategy was of attrition and was unsuccessful; Rome never gave up a prize.<br/>The game is developed in an operational scale &ndash; area-based map. It is designed for two players with one running the ROMAN forces and the other the CARTHAGINIAN forces -including Syracuse. The game lasts approximately 3-4 hours and uses a two sided system to handle the mechanics of play: cards and counters. The players will have to use their troops and their resources to obtain victory points while eliminating enemy forces and occupying cities in the map. It is not a card driven game as the cards are used to bring about events that influence battles, secure reinforcements, and provide resources with which to carry on the fight.<br/>The ROMAN player will be on the offensive during the whole game as he has to conquer the whole island to get victory. CARTHAGINIAN player focuses on spoiling Roman campaigns and plans with ambushes, sallies and bad weather cards. Also he has to recruit an army as he doesn&acute;t has any at the beginning of the game.<br/>The ROMAN player must plan his offensives carefully as he will need a new army and resources for each one. Also he will need to build a fleet his doesn&acute;t have at the start of the war. The sea contest will be evenly match and you better take into account bad weather as it sinks more ships than enemy action.<br/>Siege warfare takes a prominent role in this game as every city in the game map is a walled on with his own intrinsic garrison.<br/>Like all the games of this Series, the rules are simple and straight forward.

The field is comprised of two opponents laid out in 10 X 5 (1/2 the field we call the courts). That area once established remains a constant grid for play throughout the game. Thus the tiles making a randomized board.<br/><br/>2) The tiles used above are the playing board and the playing pieces.<br/><br/>3) The game uses the relationships of one tiles to another as a mechanic to manipulate luck, and unforeseen or uncontrolled  events.

Featuring direct head-to-head combat, amazing art, a new AEG world, and unique mechanics by designer David Gregg, Nightfall will be the deck-building game to own.<br/><br/>Before the game begins, there is a draft to determine which cards are available for purchase, and by whom. During this draft players select two cards from the set for their personal archives, and they also select cards to put into the common area. The cards drafted into personal archives may only be purchased by the player who drafted them.<br/><br/>After the table has been set with the private and common cards, players begin play.<br/><br/>The meat of Nightfall is in the chaining mechanic, which was partially developed with the help of people right here on BoardGameGeek.<br/><br/>Each card has a main color and two linking colors. If you can match the main color of a card to one of the linking colors of the previous card, you can chain those cards together. Once a chain is started, players all get an opportunity to link additional cards onto the chain during that turn.<br/><br/>Cards in the chain resolve in reverse order: first in, last out. Instant effects fire off as cards come off the chain, doing damage to your opponents or bringing characters into play to defend you and attack your opponents.<br/><br/>The object of Nightfall is to put wounds into your opponents&rsquo; decks and end the game with the least amount of wounds in your deck. But beware: the more wounds a person has, the more enraged they become and the faster their deck works, meaning more cards and bigger chains will come your way!<br/><br/>Nightfall's base set releases with starting decks of 12 cards for up to 5 players, and 24 distinct cards (7 copies of each) for drafting during play.<br/><br/>The box contains card dividers, and is in the same format as the much heralded Wrath of the Elements box for Thunderstone.<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Nightfall: Martial Law<br/>    Nightfall: Blood Country<br/>    Nightfall: The Coldest War<br/>    Nightfall: Dark Rages<br/>    Nightfall: Eastern Skies<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.6345, "bayesaverage": 6.32119, "designers": ["David Gregg"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Horror"], "name": "Chainmaster", "playingtime": 45, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "1125"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "657"}], "average": 6.54466, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.60867, "numcomments": 952}, "88414": {"mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management"], "usersrated": 31, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1514476.jpg", "wishing": 3, "owned": 97, "trading": 2, "id": 88414, "yearpublished": 2009, "maxplayers": 10, "numweights": 3, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1514476_t.jpg", "publishers": ["YOKA Games"], "families": ["Romance of the Three Kingdoms", "San Guo Sha"], "description": "This is the first expansion of San Guo Sha, aka Killers of the Three Kingdoms.

My solo game rules for the pictured dice (which can be purchased at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.flyingbuffalo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.flyingbuffalo.com/</a>) is as follows:<br/><br/>Many Dungeon Dice<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll need the many monster dice, paper to keep track of your character and draw out your dungeon, and a pen.<br/><br/>Roll the D20 to discover how many monsters you must encounter during your game and mark this value down. You must defeat this number of monsters to win the game without being slain yourself. Any gold and jewels you have left at the end if yours to keep.<br/><br/>Then, with the five numbered dice, assign one die to each 5 values - monster hit point die, and attack and defense dice.<br/><br/>Roll the map die, drawing out your dungeon as you go. Be as artistic as you like in this. Stairs and doors always have traps. Each door you roll will enter into a room, and there will always be a unlocked exit door in an adjacent wall. The T corridor branches off into other hallways and you may backtrack your path if you wish during exploration.<br/><br/>If you roll a door or a stair check first for a trap by rolling the 3 trap dice, if two faces match that trap is sprung.<br/><br/>Next, if you rolled a door, you enter the room. Roll the colored monster die to see what level of monster you will fight, and roll the corresponding colored monster die to see what you will fight. You always have initiative in an encounter.<br/><br/>To battle:<br/><br/>Roll your Battle Strength die and add that value to your Battle Strength for a magical weapon if you possess one. Then roll for the monster. Depending on the color and type of monster they will have different strengths and powers as summarized in the rules.<br/><br/>Once you have defeated a monster you may roll for treasure using the Treasure Die.<br/><br/>Explore the dungeon until you defeat/kill all the monsters you are required to. If you do this count yourself lucky you survived with your limbs and sanity intact.

Using a brawl between shepherds and millers as a pretext, Picrochole, King of Lerne, declared war on Gargantua's father, Grandgousier. A model of the enlightened monarch of the Renaissance, Grandgousier attempted to avert war by all means. But Picrochole, taking this as a sign of Grandgousier's weakness, invaded his neighbor's kingdom. Grandgousier calls upon his son, and Gargantua, at the head of an army of his loyal companions, inflicts a humiliating defeat on Picrochole, who flees on the back of a donkey.<br/><br/>The Picrocholine Wars simulates this celebrated episode of French literature through a fun and simple wargame. Players will find and discover in this game all of the events that gave the novel parodying the chivalric tomes of the era its charms: the giant Gargantua, of course, and his friends Gymnast and Fr&egrave;re Jean, but also the cheating Picrochole and his lieutenants.<br/><br/>Though it has its &quot;rabelaisien&quot; side, The Picrocholine Wars is a balanced game in which each camp has its own distinct strengths and during which players will have to adopt the role of both the attacker and the defender. The Picrocholine Wars combines gaming pleasure with culture and history, and is ideal for initiating new players into wargaming.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.6, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Nicolas Rident"], "categories": ["Medieval", "Novel-based", "Wargame"], "name": "les guerres Picrocholines", "playingtime": 90, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 6.794, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.901368, "numcomments": 15}, "88487": {"mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Deck / Pool Building", "Hand Management"], "usersrated": 188, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic834272.jpg", "wishing": 25, "owned": 595, "trading": 15, "id": 88487, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 12, "wanting": 13, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic834272_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Arclight", "Asmodee", "FunBox Jogos", "Stone Blade Entertainment"], "families": ["Ascension Deck Building Game"], "description": "This promotional card was given out to participants in the first Ascension Game Day December 4th 2010.<br/><br/>Cost: 7 Runes<br/><br/>Enlightened Hero<br/><br/>Reveal the top card of the center deck.

Each shootout proceeds as follows:<br/><br/><br/>    Each player chooses one card in hand and places it face down in front of them.<br/>    Each player raises one hand, then (on the command of the current dueling master) points their gun hand at an opponent.<br/>    Each player reveals their card, then they see what happens:<br/><br/><br/>&bull; If you fired at someone with a gun (whether pistol or rifle), any shots aimed at you miss because you were moving when you fired.<br/>&bull; If you fired at someone with a pistol and they are behind a barricade, nothing happens as the barricade stops your shot.<br/>&bull; If you fired at someone with a rifle and they are behind a barricade, the rifle penetrates the barricade and they're hit; they flip their heart card to show a grave marker, indicating that they're out for the rest of the duel.<br/>&bull; If you were behind a barricade, then you're hit or not hit depending on the weapon(s) fired at you.<br/>&bull; If you were reloading and someone fired at you, then you're hit; flip your heart card to show a grave marker as you're out for the remainder of the duel.<br/>&bull; If you were reloading and no one fired at you, take all of your previously played cards back into your hand.<br/><br/>If more than one player still has a heart showing, place the previously played cards aside and start a new shootout as described above. If only one player has a heart, then this player earns $1; after this, everyone takes all their cards in hand and begins a new round of shootouts.<br/><br/>As soon as one player has $5, the game ends and this player wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.0, "bayesaverage": 5.43212, "designers": ["Jorge Pi\u00f1an", "Ignacio S\u00e1nchez Usera"], "categories": ["American West", "Card Game"], "name": "Duel: Once Upon a Game in the West", "playingtime": 15, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "12696"}], "average": 4.37816, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 2.3832, "numcomments": 23}, "84462": {"mechanics": ["Auction/Bidding", "Route/Network Building"], "usersrated": 321, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic820296.jpg", "wishing": 89, "owned": 1594, "trading": 43, "id": 84462, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 21, "wanting": 28, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic820296_t.jpg", "publishers": ["2F-Spiele", "Arclight"], "families": ["Power Grid", "Promotional Cards"], "description": "Power Grid: Warehouse (Funkenschlag - Lagerhalle) is part of the Power Grid: BGG Promo Card Set.<br/><br/>It was originally a limited edition 3 card set for Power Grid (aka Funkenschlag 2nd Edition) available for a donation at the Essen Spiel show 2010.<br/><br/>You can store up to three resources of any type in the Warehouse for future use in your own power plants.

Albert Sidney Johnston&rsquo;s Army of Mississippi destroyed the Union&rsquo;s Army of the Tennessee at Shiloh in April 1862, it brought despair to a Northern public already restive over the war&rsquo;s course. A few weeks later the entire world saw how a single Confederate ironclad could isolate the Union&rsquo;s Army of the Potomac on the Virginia Peninsula; the Union ship that might have saved the day, the ironclad Monitor, had been swamped in heavy seas and sank before it could arrive on the scene. With no help of reinforcement, resupply or rescue and Robert E. Lee&rsquo;s Army of Northern Virginia launching incessant attacks, George McClellan surrendered his command. The American Civil War was over after roughly a year of fighting.<br/><br/>Fifty years later, the United States and Confederate States share a divided continent. The South has expanded into the Caribbean Basin and Central America, cutting a canal across Nicaragua and establishing new states and territories. Under pressure from their British and French allies, the Confederate States gradually eliminated slavery, but severe class and racial tensions remain. Northern politicians know talk of re-unification is an easy crowd-pleaser; even the United States Navy continues to name warships for Southern states and cities.<br/><br/>War in Europe has finally brought the long-simmering American feud into open conflict. The United States, pressured by its German allies, seeks to disrupt trade through the Caribbean Basin and deny these resources to the Allied war effort. The Confederacy, outnumbered and outgunned by its rival, must protect its economic lifelines if it is to survive as an independent state.<br/><br/>Confederate States Navy is a supplement for the Great War at Sea series, based on battles that never happened, waged by a fleet that never existed.

After Britain refused to deliver newly ordered Turkish battleships, the Turko-German fleet bombarded Russian forts, signaling the Ottoman Empire&rsquo;s entrance into World War One.<br/><br/>Ottoman Sunset 2nd edition, by designer Darin Leviloff, is a stand-alone solitaire States of SiegeTM game on World War One in the Near East from 1914-1918. The player controls the Young Turks (CUP or Committee of Union and Progress) as they try to keep the Ottoman Empire alive amidst the struggles of the Great War.<br/><br/>After many years of being the &ldquo;Sick man of Europe,&rdquo; by the late 19th century the Ottoman Empire attempted to reform and modernize itself. Ironically, such attempts convinced restive nationalities such as the Greeks, Romanians, Bulgarians, etc., to assert their independence and/or seek to expand their territory.<br/><br/>This weakness caused other Imperial Powers to seize Ottoman territory, both formally and informally. By the outbreak of World War One, the Ottoman Empire was reduced to a core of territory in Asia Minor, the Levant, the Hejaz, Mesopotamia, and a sliver of European territory. This collapse led the military-political leadership in Turkey to take over under the guise of the Young Turks.<br/><br/>The Ottoman Empire began with lofty strategic goals, but soon faced a hard slog, defending its core empire against far-flung British-led forces, Russian armies, and a Hashemite Arab revolt. Furthermore, ongoing campaigns on other fronts, such as those with Austria against Romania in the East, against Italy on the Isonzo, and of course the draining stalemate of the Western Front had a direct impact on events in this theater. Like Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire needed direct German aid to keep it in the conflict.<br/><br/>Despite victories at Kut and Gallipoli, by October 1918, the Turks had about all they could take and surrendered.

Players construct a modular board and then strategically position their dice to make a capture. When two dice connect, the die with the highest facing side wins.<br/><br/>SET UP:<br/><br/>1) The board:<br/>Each player picks two colors of Nestortiles and takes all the tiles of those colors. The rest of the tiles are shuffled face down and patched together into a 6x6 grid. The grid is flipped over, revealing the pattern of pips. This will be used as the game board.<br/><br/>2) The dice:<br/>Players now use their twelve Nestortiles to assemble two dice in any way they please.<br/><br/>3) Placing the dice on the board:<br/>Players now place their dice in the corners of their own side of the game board with any side face up, so long as it does not match the number of the tile the die is on. Who ever is start player should place his or her dice first, giving the second player a chance to evaluate the position and place his or her dice accordingly.<br/><br/>Example: In one of Eva's corners, there is a tile with four pips. She may place either of her dice in this corner, so long as it is not showing 4 pips on its top face. Once she places both of her dice, it will be Nestor's turn to place his. Then Eva will make the first move.<br/><br/>Players may decide turn order in any manner they like. Start player will alternate each round.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE:<br/>The first player to &quot;capture&quot; one of the other player's dice wins the round. First player to win 3 rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/><br/>1) Moving dice:<br/>When players take their turns, they move one of their dice three times. Moving a die means &quot;tilting&quot; it on to the next space forward, backward, left, or right, so that the top face of the die becomes the side facing that direction.<br/><br/>Example: Eva will play first. She decides to move her die that shows a green 5 on top. First, she will move it one space forward. Eva now tilts the die forward so that the green 5 faces forward and the die rests squarely on the next tile forward.<br/><br/>Now this same die shows a blue 2 on top and she wants to move this one space to the left. She tilts the die to the left so that the blue 2 is now the side facing left and the die lands squarely on the next tile to the left..<br/><br/>Now this die has a blue 5 on top, and Eva wants to move it one more space forward, so she tilts the die forward, moving the die onto the next tile forward so that his blue 5 faces forward, toward her opponent. Eva's turn is turn is now over.<br/><br/>At no point during a player's turn may they move their die back onto a tile it has already touched during the same turn. This means players cannot retrace their path or repeat moves during the same turn.<br/><br/>Dice may not be moved diagonally. Dice may not be rotated.<br/><br/>2) Making a capture:<br/>When two opposing dice are in adjacent squares, their facing sides are compared. The die with the highest value on its facing side captures the other and the round is over.<br/><br/>Example: One of Nestor's dice shows a 4 on one side. Eva is able to move her die so that it ends on the space adjacent to this side with a value of 5 facing Nestor's 4. Eva's 5 beats Nestor's 4, so Eva wins the round.<br/><br/>Dice cannot be captured &quot;in passing.&quot; In other words, the sides of dice are not compared for a capture unless a player has completed all three moves of his or her turn. If dice are in adjacent squares on the first or second move of a turn, there is no comparison of sides and no capture.<br/><br/>Sometimes, a die will end a turn on a &quot;matching&quot; tile. A die is said to be on a matching tile when its top face is of the same value as the tile. When a die is on a matching tile, all of its outward facing sides double in value for as long as the die remains on the matching tile. This means it may capture a die showing a side of greater value than it would normally be able to capture.<br/><br/>Example: One of Eva's dice is on a matching space, and its outward facing sides show values of 2, 3, 4, and 4. Because she is on a matching tile, their values are now 4, 6, 8, and 8. As soon as she moves off the tile, their values will return to normal.<br/><br/>Let's say Eva ended her turn on a matching tile that is adjacent to one of Nestor's dice. His die shows a 6 facing hers, and her die shows a 4 facing his. Ordinarily Eva would lose the round in this position, but because she is on a matching tile, the value of her 4 doubles to an 8. Her 8 beats Nestor's 6 and she wins the round.<br/><br/>If dice are compared for capture and their values are equal, no capture takes place on that turn.<br/><br/>STARTING A NEW ROUND<br/><br/>Once a capture has been made, players collect their dice and prepare for a new round. Players should decide before a game begins whether or not they want the ability to remake their dice between rounds. Unless otherwise stated, dice should retain their composition for the duration of the game, and the board should likewise remain intact for all 3-5 rounds.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has won three rounds and is declared the winner.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["James William Ryan"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Dice"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Tilting Dice", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 4.75, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 3.75, "numcomments": 1}, "88608": {"mechanics": ["Acting", "Co-operative Play", "Partnerships"], "usersrated": 47, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic873876.jpg", "wishing": 2, "owned": 186, "trading": 3, "id": 88608, "yearpublished": 2009, "maxplayers": 99, "numweights": 4, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic873876_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Hasbro"], "families": [], "description": "The card game that gives everyone a chance to shine!

Two players, Black and White, play on a go board ruled into a grid of 19 ranks (rows) by 19 files (columns) with a total of 361 intersections. Each player has a set of 90 pieces of 34 different types. The pieces are round and flattened like go stones. In all, the players must remember 65 different moves. The pieces are generally of the same size, though black pieces may be slightly larger than white pieces. Each piece has its name in the form of one or two Japanese characters marked on its face, in white on black stones and in black on white stones. On the reverse side of most pieces are other characters in red; this side is turned up to indicate that the piece has been promoted during play. - Wiki (<a target='_blank' href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko_shogi\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko_shogi</a>)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": [], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Ko Shogi", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 240, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 6.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "84558": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Storytelling", "Voting"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic824540.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 3, "trading": 0, "id": 84558, "yearpublished": 2008, "maxplayers": 7, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic824540_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Realize"], "families": [], "description": "Id&eacute;spelet is both a board game and a creativity tool.

To begin with eaxh player has 3 ghouls, these are; fast, good at searching but weak in combat. During each turn the players will raise a skeleton and a zombie to supplement their force. So more figures will enter play as the game progresses. The turn order is determined randomly by pulling stones from a bag. There are six stones, one for each player and the other two represent the resurrection of skeleton &amp; zombie. When a players stone is drawn, they are allowed to move all their figures. No diagonal movement is allowed, nor are you allowed to enter a space occupied by other players pieces, and finally there's a stcking limit of 4 figures per area. After moving any figures against to an enemy must fight (this is compulsory), otherwise they may search for artifacts. Specially prepared dice are used for both searching &amp; combat. These dice have the following faces; 2 x swords, 1 x shield, 2 x eye and 1 x swirl. During searching a number of dice are rolled, if any show the 'eye' the item has been found and will need to be carried back to the Necromancer in order to be used or scored. In combat, both players roll their respective dice, lokking for swords or shields. Basically a shield will negate a sword, any any excess swords on either side will kill a minion each. Spells can be played to influence the outcome of a battle ie 'Battle rage' - All swirls count as swords, thereby increasing your chance of killing your opponents figures.<br/><br/>zombies are slow, not good in searching but the best fighters, skeletons are average across the board. The Necromancer himself, is very good at searching, but otherwise similar to a skeleton.Points are awarded for kills and for collecting items. The first player to acquire 25 points wins. Sets of gems are worth more than singles, scrolls give you another spell but are not worth any points, relics are worth 2 points, the chest is 4 (this is placed in the centre of the board) and potions are worth 1 but can be used in combat to roll an extra die.

And to make the games played with them as enjoyable as is possible. Because of this things such as gunnery have been simplified as much as possible.<br/><br/>&quot;Ships gunnery at the time of the Armada was a thing in a state of flux. It is as well to contemplate, that ships carried many different types of ordinance, all intermingled together on the same deck. The logistics of serving such a varied armament in a rapid manner was beyond the capabilities of the time, and I would hazard a guess beyond us today as well. Most authorities give a maximum rate of fire for the guns of the Spaniards as once, yes once, a day. Small pieces and hand held weapons were obviously much quicker to reload. Even the English rate of fire is said to have been at best once an hour. If this difference had been used in the rules the Spanish player's would be sitting on their for much of the game, and the English for quite long periods. The solution to this problem can be read in the rules themselves...&quot;<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>Rules set covers scale, speed of units, sailing rules, handling classes, wind effects, firing, ranges, firing charts, special effects table (effectively a sort of critical hit table), putting out fires, effects of bowing on hull factors, boarding, morale, special rules for galleys, a ship list, and a brief bibliography.

Originally a game for two, three or four players, it's mostly known today in an adapted version for two players brought into England by the Mathematics professor A.S. Besikovitch, and later included in David Parlett's Oxford Guide to Card Games. This version is played with exposed cards and symmetrical hands, giving it a strong strategic flavour.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the (Besikovitch) game each player chooses two sets without overlapping with the other player, typically in a 32-card deck, out of which one is their own trump. Cards are dealt for the first player, who keeps the cards of their both sets; the second player gets exactly the same cards in the other sets and both their hands are filled up with the rest of the cards. As an example: a player who's chosen spades and clubs with spades as trumps keeps the cards in both sets and gives all their red cards together with the undealt cards to the other player, who then selects the analog cards to the first player's in the red sets with hearts as trumps, gives the rest of the red cards back to the first player and finally keeps all the remaining black cards. Both hands are symmetrical, and play can start.<br/><br/>From now on each turn a player lays a card in a pile between both players; before the next player can play out a card of their choice they must throw one that is superior in value to the top card in the pile or a trump. If the player can't or doesn't want to do so they must take the whole pile and forfeit the turn. So, each player throws two cards in a row: one following the previous card, and one to be followed by the opponent. The first player to get rid of all cards in their hand is the winner.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": [], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Card Game"], "name": "Challenge", "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.25, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.94722, "numcomments": 2}, "88881": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling"], "usersrated": 22, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1912358.png", "wishing": 2, "owned": 52, "trading": 2, "id": 88881, "yearpublished": 2011, "maxplayers": 99, "numweights": 1, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1912358_t.png", "publishers": ["999 Games", "Four Esses", "HUCH! & friends"], "families": ["Yacht"], "description": "In this Yahtzee-like dice game, players get to throw the five dice up to three times on their turn while attempting to make high-scoring sets, whether of animals, flags, or something else; many versions of this game have been released, and the symbols matter only for what you check off, not for a point value since each symbol is worth 1.

Terra Shrinka has a unique lunar tide system that controls the water and will erode the island if you don't work together to scout out the island, gather resources, and build dams fast enough.<br/><br/>THE STORY SO FAR<br/><br/>On a South Pacific flight your plane is struck by lighting and makes an emergency landing on a small desert island.  The good news is that everyone survived the landing, the bad news is that the tides are rising and the island is flooding.  It's up to the brave passengers to step forward and bring order to the chaos.  You survived the crash, now can you survive the flood?  The very earth is shrinking around you!  Can you dam the flood?<br/><br/>THE OBJECTIVE<br/><br/>Dam the flood by creating an unbroken chain of dams from one board edge to the other and protect the crash-site in the process!<br/><br/>HOW THE GAME PLAYS<br/><br/>The game starts with the board taking its turn. The board&rsquo;s turn is broken into five phases:<br/><br/>1. Move Moon Tracker<br/>2. Add Flood Cube(s)<br/>3. Roll Moon Die that matches current Moon Phase<br/>4. Draw card if &ldquo;N&rdquo; or &ldquo;S&rdquo; is rolled.<br/>5. Move Flood water and resolve damage<br/><br/>After the water does a good job of destroying board squares, it is the players&rsquo; turn. Each player starts with their Team Leader in the Crash Site. During the players&rsquo; turn, they do the following:<br/><br/>1. Explore and Move<br/>2. Create<br/>3. Transfer<br/>4. Set Dams<br/><br/>Each player has a starting character. Are you the ren-faire blacksmith, or are you the bag lady? No matter whom, it is each team&rsquo;s job to explore this uncharted little island. The survivors find food to bribe more recruits off the plane. They make networks of people to transfer gathered goods. And finally, they create and set dams to stop the water. This requires lots of communication and teamwork to protect your Crash Site and stop the water from spreading any more. If your Crash Site is destroyed, you lose. Otherwise, keep track of how many squares were destroyed when you finally blocked off the flood and try to do better next time. There are additional scenarios to add replay value and ensure that you want to come back for more.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Sam M.

The board has five tracks, one for each product (for the sake of the game, they all have the same price). On the track, there are three markers: The lowest is the price that the producers get; the middle one represents the overall cost including shipping costs, the third one the price that a municipality buys the goods for (the distance between the latter two is the profit margin). The mechanism is a simple &quot;play one card, draw one card&quot;. The cards have events printed on them, with each event either influencing the own track (with some choices to make) or that of another player. There are also hidden cards which can be played face-down to another player's track. These are revealed at the end of the game and influence the the maximum prize a municipality will pay and the maximum abuse of producers it will tolerate. A player who exceeds either of these levels is out of the game; the remaining player with the highest profit margin is the winner.<br/>The game has some push your luck element (you can make a rough guess about the tolerable levels from the number of cards played against you) and is embedded in a curricular project in the schools of the state. <br/>It is not for sale nor does it come in a box. 12 copies were hand-made by Reinhold Wittig, of which 10 copies will be used in schools beginning in 2011.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Hilko Drude", "Reinhold Wittig"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Economic", "Educational", "Political"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Blick hinter die Kulissen", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 15, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 1}, "88805": {"mechanics": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1566543.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "trading": 0, "id": 88805, "yearpublished": 1994, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1566543_t.jpg", "publishers": ["MMG Ltd."], "families": [], "description": "Hi Fans!

The days of easy drilling are long gone and oil companies are searching in ever deeper, riskier and more fragile places just to secure our daily fixx of capitalist cog-grease. The battle is on to protect these areas from the next 'Deepwater Horizon' and with a couple of dice, a few coins and a friend, you can re-enact this struggle. It's Greenpeace vs. the Oil Company, trying to establish marine reserves in the very territory the other player wants to exploit. Through a mix of strategic lobbying, exploration, occupation and reserve creation, one of you will triumph. But beware: too many blowouts and you'll have a deepwater slaughter on your hands. And if all the animals die, you both lose!<br/><br/><br/>You only need some coins and 2 dice to play. Everything else is included in the files. Game play takes place on a grided map of the ocean, containing squares of varying depths of water. One player takes on the role of environmental activists, Greenpeace, while the other, the role of a Big Nasty Oil company. Greenpeace is trying to establish marine reserves in the very places that Big Oil is trying to drill. You see, oil (in the form of coins) is available everywhere, but severely limited in shallow and medium depths. So once the easy oil runs out, the oil company is pushed into deep water. Drilling involves rolling two dice, one after the other. If the second number is larger than the first, this drill results in profit (coins equal to the difference in the two numbers) but if you roll a double, it's a blow out. Blow outs are more damaging in deeper water and any blow out might affect surrounding wildlife (animal counters are distributed randomly for each game). If any one species gets totally wiped out, both players lose.<br/><br/>Each player has 3 strategies to choose from each turn and there is enough variation to ensure that no single outcome is guaranteed (although a lot of animals consistently die).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Andrew Sheerin", "Andrew Tompkins"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Educational", "Environmental", "Print & Play"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Deepsea Desperation", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 15, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 4.33333, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.942809, "numcomments": 1}, "88829": {"mechanics": ["Tile Placement"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic838268.jpg", "wishing": 2, "owned": 6, "trading": 0, "id": 88829, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic838268_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Web published)", "Overnight Games"], "families": ["Dominoes", "Holidays: Christmas"], "description": "Designed for the 2010 Christmas Print and Play Game Design Contest, Jingle Jangle is a domino-like placement game which scores points for arranging tiles into the appropriate patterns.<br/><br/>Jingle Jangle uses a special set of 30 tiles with two bells on them called jangles. The game can be played by two, three or four players and the size of the hand varies with the number of players.<br/>&bull; Two players get 14 jangles each, with two jangles left over.<br/>&bull; Three players get 9 jangles each, with three jangles left over.<br/>&bull; Four players get 7 jangles each, with two jangles left over.<br/>In the case of three left over jangles, one is put away out of the game and not exposed, to leave two jangles in the starter. The starter is the pair of left over jangles. These are turned face up and put side by side to make a square in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>Jangles are placed on the table, vertically or horizontally, played out from the starter square. The idea is to build a &ldquo;crossword puzzle&rdquo; grid of repeated color patterns in the rows and columns.<br/><br/>Any set of two or more adjacent jangles ending in a row or column is called a group. The jangles must be played so that the bells in each group form a (repeating) pattern. The possible patterns are:<br/><br/>&bull; a single color repeated, example: red, red, red or<br/>&bull; two colors alternating, example: red, blue, red, blue, red, blue or<br/>&bull; three colors in a repeating cycle, example: red, blue, yellow, red, blue, yellow, red, blue, yellow or<br/>&bull; four colors in a repeating cycle, example: red, blue, yellow, green, red, blue, yellow, green or<br/>&bull; or all five colors in a repeating cycle, example: red, blue, yellow, green, purple, red, blue, yellow, green, purple<br/>As soon as a group has a repeated color in it, or contains all five colors, the pattern for that group is fixed, and future jangles that extend the group must conform to the established pattern. As the layout grows, it is possible for a row or column to contain two or more groups, separated by spaces.<br/><br/>Each jangle must be placed so that it correctly extends two or more groups, but you are not allowed to create a set of four jangles side by side in the layout, touching along their long sides.<br/><br/>If a player thinks he cannot play, he exposes his hand. The other players can then (if they wish) point out any plays he might not have seen. In this case the player must play a tile. If more than one possible play is pointed out, the player has the option of picking the one he likes. If no play is pointed out, then the player scores zero and places no jangle. He is not out of the game, but has to wait for his next turn to see if he can then find a play.<br/><br/>The game ends one of two ways: 1) When one player places all his jangles. The other players who started after him get to place one more jangle, however. 2) When no player can place a jangle.<br/><br/>Scores are counted and added as the jangles are placed. Each bell on a jangle is worth 5 points, The score is the product of the new lengths of all extended groups. If the jangle used to extend the group is a double, then the score is also doubled.<br/><br/>All players lose points for the jangles remaining in their hands when the game is ended. Doubles are -5 points and all other jangles are -25 points.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Kelley Callery"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Print & Play"], "name": "Domino Bead Game", "playingtime": 20, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 3}, "88533": {"mechanics": ["Memory", "Pattern Recognition"], "usersrated": 6, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic907034.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 15, "trading": 2, "id": 88533, "yearpublished": 2011, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic907034_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Educational Insights"], "families": ["Animals: Deer"], "description": "This is a color matching game for younger children, where players have fun in the forest with moose!<br/><br/>Players take turns dealing cards featuring Buck the Forest Ranger and his pokey pal Moose.

A 90 second timer is provided with the game to provide a  fair length for both phases.<br/><br/>During setup, survivor cards will be handed out.  One of the survivors will be Patient Zero and become a zombie at the end of the first day.  Each survivor starts with one item.  After everyone has an item, the group elects their leader.  Since no one knows anyone else's role, it is possible to elect Patient Zero as the group's leader.  Anytime the leader becomes a zombie, the survivors must elect a new leader before beginning the day phase.<br/><br/>During the day the elected leader of the survivors draws resource cards and the survivors discuss how to divide them up.  Some of the Survivors, however, are infected and will eventually join the Zombies attacking the Survivors.  At the end of each day, players check their character cards to see if they have become a zombie.<br/><br/>During the night, the players who have become zombies play attack cards of various types against the remaining survivors.  The survivors must work together to defend themselves using the resources they found during the day to resist and shunt off zombie attacks in order to survive.

This also means you will have to earn money to be able to afford those purchases.<br/><br/>The prices of the various merchandises are set by supply and demand, and can sometimes go very high!

It is a metal suitcase-style box with a plastic insert that is perfect for holding the cards included in the Munchkin card games. It also comes with some German cards and a Kill-O-Meter.<br/><br/>Where do I get the Sammlerkoffer?<br/>Pegasus Spiele's shop is the easiest way to order it. See the &quot;Links&quot; section for the link to the game page, which has a link to the shop page. The site is mostly in German, but there is a translation option at the top right that makes it easy enough to get through the ordering process without knowing any German (note that it will not translate the product description). Note that you will not pay during the checkout process. Instead, Pegasus Spiele will contact you (using English) and give you instructions on how to pay via either bank transfer or Paypal.<br/><br/>How much does it cost?<br/>It costs 39,95 Euro plus an additional 15 Euro shipping to most locations (at least to the US and Australia, Europe might be less). Payment must be made by either International Bank Transfer or Paypal as specified in the previous question.<br/><br/>What else do you get with it?<br/>There are 101 included cards with German text and backs for various sets. There is also a Kill-O-Meter. The Sammlerkoffer also has its own special rule.<br/><br/>What is the Sammlerkoffer's special rule?<br/>If you are playing with cards that all come from a single Sammlerkoffer, the owner of the Sammlerkoffer may, once per game, take a card from either draw pile at any time that they are not in combat. If more than one person brings a Sammlerkoffer, then play with cards from the heavier Sammlerkoffer.<br/><br/>Are the cards usable with English Munchkin sets?<br/>Some of them can be mixed into your existing sets, but the German backs for some cards are different from the original versions, so they would stand out.<br/><br/>     The backs of the Munchkin cards, both Treasures and Doors, are significantly darker than the English versions.<br/>     The card backs for the following games have the game name in German: Munchkin Bites!; The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin; and Munchkin Booty.<br/>     The cards with the same backs are for Star Munchkin; Super Munchkin; Munchkin Cthulhu; and Munchkin Fu.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>How many cards are there for each themed set?<br/>The breakdown is as follows:<br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         Munchkin: 45 Doors and 30 Treasures<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Super Munchkin: 1 Door and 1 Treasure<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Munchkin Bites!: 6 Doors and 1 Treasure<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Munchkin Cthulhu: 2 Doors and 4 Treasures<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin: 1 Treasure<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Star Munchkin: 3 Doors and 1 Treasure<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Munchkin Booty: 2 Doors and 1 Treasure<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Munchkin Fu: 3 Doors<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Can sleeved cards fit into the Sammlerkoffer?<br/>Some can, but it is a tight fit. The 56mm x 87mm standard sleeves from Mayday just fit inside the box. Nobody has reported yet whether the premium version of the sleeves or if other types of sleeves fit or not. Note that the sleeved cards do take up more room, so you will get about 25% less cards in the box.<br/><br/>How many cards fit inside the Sammlerkoffer?<br/>By my estimate, approximately 4,000 unsleeved cards or 3,000 sleeved cards can fit if you pack them tightly. This is not counting the areas set aside for rules, dice and Dungeon cards.<br/><br/>How are the card areas arranged?<br/>The plastic base of the Sammlerkoffer includes spaces for various decks and expansions. The included insert suggests putting each core set and expansion in a different slot, but as the ratio of decks to expansions is approximately equivalent to the ratio between Doors and Treasures, it is possible to use a pair of slots (one large, one medium) for the Doors and Treasures of sets with one 112 card expansion or two 56 card expansions, which is perfect for most of the Munchkin themes. The number of slots and approximate number of unsleeved cards that each slot can hold are as follows:<br/><br/>     11 slots for core sets or Doors of an expanded set fitting about 190 cards each.<br/>     12 slots for 112 card expansions or Treasures of an expanded set fitting about 125 cards each.<br/>     6 slots for Boosters and Promo cards fitting about 60 cards each.<br/>     4 slots for Dungeon cards fitting about 40 Dungeon cards each.<br/>     1 slot for storing rules, dice, bookmarks, Kill-O-Meters, pawns and whatever else you want to store.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Is the Kill-O-Meter the same as the Steve Jackson Games version?<br/>Not quite. It features the same art, but it uses different card stock.<br/><br/>What icons are on the cards?<br/>All 101 cards have an icon for the Sammlerkoffer. In addition, 55 of the cards have the More Good Cards icon, one card has the Kill-O-Meter icon, and one card has the Crazed Caverns icon.<br/><br/>What are the translations of the included cards?<br/>We do not provide a translation of the cards here. That being said, all but 18 of the cards have already been translated or have equivalent cards in English (see the &quot;More Information&quot; section, below, for hints on where to look).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 5.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Steve Jackson (I)"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Comic Book / Strip", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Horror", "Humor", "Pirates", "Science Fiction"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Munchkin Sammlerkoffer", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 90, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.52174, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 2.63537, "numcomments": 4}, "88967": {"mechanics": ["Set Collection", "Storytelling"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic890121.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 2, "trading": 0, "id": 88967, "yearpublished": 2004, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic890121_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Self-Published)", "Bund Deutscher Hebammen e.V."], "families": [], "description": "The name of the game comes from ELective SEstio.

Many cards of the game show that change, from traditional to modern astrology. One of the main reasons, was the discovery of new planets. Until recently, Astrologists weren&rsquo;t aware of the existence of the planets in the far reaches of our solar system. Due to the discovery of Neptune, Uranus,  Pluto and the consolidation of the Sun centered planetary system, astrology had to change.

The exact circumstances and names have been changed to protect the guilty.<br/><br/>This game portrays the fauna of the District of Chaos and the institutions of its home rule government in realistic situations. Some parts of this game may be unsuitable for the politically naive.<br/><br/>Home Rulette is a political parody game themed on political corruption. In the game, players move their pieces along the path based on dice rolls.  Other players can impede movement through card-play.  Cards are gained by landing on spaces.  The first player to reach the end space is the winner.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Home Rulette takes place in the District of Chaos, a make believe capitol city of a world super power.  The game is totally fictional.  Obviously nothing so ridiculous as the characters, events or institutions contained in this game could exist in the real world.This make-believe capital city had been created by the country&rsquo;s Founding Fathers as a neutral place, free from local political funny-business, where people could safely go and conduct the nation&rsquo;s business. &lt;p&gt;However, this concept had one fatal flaw:  it worked, and as we all know, its standard government policy to try and fix things that aren&rsquo;t broken. As with any congressional action, many interest groups had to be satisfied.  One of these groups was the Humor Lobby.  If improvements had to be made, they should be funny.  Congress thought long and hard on what could be done to generate the most amount of laughter over the longest period of time.  Then the idea came to them.  Why not take the capital city which belongs to all of the country&rsquo;s citizens, and hand it over to a few local people who tried to burn it down in the 1960&rsquo;s&rdquo;.  At this suggestion smiles broke out on the Congressmen&rsquo;s faces as the potential for a  massive comic effect rolled through their minds. Then like drunk Olympian gods who decided to reach down from the heavens and play some tricks on some unfortunate mortals, they passed a&hellip;..bill. The results were as anticipated.  The &lsquo;wheeling, dealing and stealing&rsquo; which occurred as a result of this act kept the city and the country laughing for years.  The District of Chaos lurched from misadventure, to atrocity, to debacle, and then back again, as the inmates played government.

One player takes control of the Hacker, entering the area through the use of hidden Jack Points while the other player sets up the defensive protocols of his company's data fortress. The Hacker initializes and maneuvers his programs through cyberspace attempting to crash the defensive programs on his way to destroying all protection the Central unit has over its data.

His purpose was the same as the wizard&rsquo;s. To leave the item in the Vault, until the proper passing of the centuries, like a good wine in a cellar.

The Wizard was a founding member of a Wizard&rsquo;s Guild that managed the impossible. To travel without moving. Although, the moving wasn&rsquo;t through space. The Guild discovered that when you manage to travel without using the dimensions of space, you travel through time. Hence, the new name of the Guild was based on the event of that movement through time, the Total Inertia Moving Event Guild, or simply T I M E Guild. Centuries passed, the coming of the Nano Age totally reformed the Guild into a T I M E Agency and gave a new agenda to its members: The molecular processing. The Agency could combine almost anything in order to create new properties it could utilize. But, some items needed to be centuries old in order to evolve or to become suitable for the processing. Therefore, the Agency decided to cooperate with its members from times past in order to bring items to the future in their desirable state. So, there were many ways for one to do that. You could simply travel back in time instruct someone in the past, to hide an item for you in a place that you knew, and travel back in your time and take the item, which now would be centuries old. Or, you could take an item from your time and hide it somewhere in the past by yourself and take it back when you return in the future. But, the T I M E Agency has many members, so that it can function properly in all Eras. If you travel back in time, too far away from your Era, it could be hard to adjust in the ways people had in the past, so, the help of another person from that Era makes the procedure easier. Usually, a Mission that includes the keeping of an item through the centuries, is concluded by 3 members: A Wizard, an Archaeologist, and a T I M E Agent specialized in traveling through the ages.<br/><br/>Components.<br/>1 board.<br/>4 player sheets.<br/>12 pawns (3 for each player).<br/>108 cards.<br/>1 rulebook.<br/><br/>GAME-PLAY. <br/>All players begin the game with a mission that requires at least 4 items of different properties. Each player during his/er round uses his/er 3 pawns, which are the Wizard, the Archaeologist and the T I M E traveler. The board of the game is divided in three regions that represent three aspects of time: Past Present and Future. Each pawn starts from one of these regions and moves in order. First the Wizard can move in regions of the Past to collect information about powerful items and artifacts and then gather the items and/or artifacts for which he possesses the proper information. Then, the Archaeologist, moves in the Present regions in which he can also gather items that are somewhat different from the Past items and he can gather some more info about artifacts of the Past that might help the Wizard find them. Last, the Time Traveler moves and starts from the future areas, in which she can also gather info and items. The difference in the future region is that, items gathered here are built for time travel, which means that they evolve as the centuries pass. It is best for the Time traveler to travel back in time and leave these items in the Past or the Present to age and become stronger. Each item in Continuum Run has tiers, 3 sometimes 4. When an item is new, it begins from tier 3. Some areas on the board allow the players to store items and take them back from another time period. For example in the Present regions there is the Continuum Vault. If the Archaeologist stores an item of tier 3 in the Present it stays there until someone takes it. The Continuum Vault has its future version, in which the time traveler can go and take the item the Archaeologist has stored. But, centuries have passed, so the item must be replaced with a lower tier. Tier 2 in this case. Different tiers have different values. So, if a player requires for his/er mission an item with a value of Ruination 3, and s/he possesses a future item that has Ruination 2, s/he may store that item in one region and take it back from the next.<br/>GOAL.<br/>Any player that has at least 4 items that his/er mission requires may cause an endgame, during which, a last round is played and then players score Victory Points for each item and/or artifact they have managed to send to the Future Area called Molecular Processor.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Tony Cimino"],

How bizarre these monsters will be depends on the players...<br/><br/>The monsters in Bizzaria are created together by players. During the game the monsters are increasingly shaped in their looks and foremost in what they say. The players use parts of cardboard faces and assemble them on a paper. Then they draw the monster around them and these papers represent the &quot;game board&quot;. Thus the &quot;game board&quot; is different and unique in each game. The cards in the game are used for the TV announcements and questions. All these clues lead the player to perceive the monsters in a certain way. In each round a special question is asked - in the form of &quot;Which of them is like this and this?&quot;. The players then look at the monsters and try to find three of them that (according to their opinion) best answer the question.<br/><br/>After each player secretly writes down his three choices they are all revealed and scored.

The first is to build up the character of the monsters where in each round the monsters comment on the actual course of events in a Bizzarian TV. The comments are entirely up to the players and they can range from a single interjection (Meow) to highly sophisticated expressions (If he were not a nihilist, I would not be such a therapist).

When you have a strength advantage in a row or column, you can push your opponent off the board and out of the fortress.  The player who loses 3 characters first is defeated.  The optional cards add a greater element of risk by allowing a player to sacrifice a character counter in exchange for a random card.  A card may give a player the edge needed to win the game, or it may yield nothing at all.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": [], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Card Game", "Fighting"], "name": "Make You Fortress", "playingtime": 15, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 5.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "85000": {"mechanics": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Point to Point Movement"], "usersrated": 228, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic847142.jpg", "wishing": 202, "owned": 431, "trading": 12, "id": 85000, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 1, "numweights": 42, "wanting": 80, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic847142_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Kokusai-Tsushin Co., Ltd.

It plays similar to Apples to Apples, using funny and disgusting combinations of IDEA and CONCEPT Cards, which together represent a finished present yet to be constructed. Taking turns playing the Head Elf, you draw an IDEA card and (reading aloud) present it on the table.  Helper Elves (the remaining players) then choose a CONCEPT card that they feel best matches the IDEA card.  Receiving the cards face down, the Head Elf then shuffles and (reading aloud) presents the CONCEPTS on the table.  Using ANY criteria, the Head Elf then chooses which Combination of IDEA and CONCEPT to green light and send to production - thus scoring one point towards the win for the player whose CONCEPT was chosen.

The Battle of Tours is a fast-playing, fun game of low complexity. To that end, much detail has been either omitted or factored into the overall mechanics. We have tried to provide as much period flavor and historical accuracy as we can, within that focus. The game should take about two hours to play to conclusion, about 50% more the first time.<br/><br/>Now, Turning Point Simulations gives you the chance to determine the future of France and Western Europe, with a tactical system which highlights the different strengths and weaknesses of both sides. For the Muslims, you&rsquo;ll find them lightly armored, cavalry heavy, and prone to piecemeal attacking by tribes. The Frankish army is a century before Charlemagne, caught in transition from Roman heavy infantry tactics and the birth of armored knights. It is mobility versus defense, Moorish spears versus Frankish long swords. And you make the decisions.<br/><br/>The Battle of Tours includes 100 counters that capture the widely varying weapons systems at this battle. You&rsquo;ll find both light and heavy infantry, light and heavy cavalry, and (a few) mounted archers. But beyond unit types, you&rsquo;ll command troops who actually fight &quot;differently&quot; from each other. Muslim units are activated by &quot;tribes,&quot; as a collection of varied unit types that all happen to move together. Frankish units activate by type&mdash;all the heavy infantry, all the light infantry, all the cavalry. The difference means the two armies &quot;feel&quot; different to command. Players designate basic &quot;orders&quot; by selecting counters, then find out who obeys. The chaos and lack of real control conveys an historic chaos that really captures the flavor of this battle, where failure can mean slaughter, but victory can mean losing control, as troops turn from soldiers to looters.  You can be up one turn and down the next.

Each tile consists of a 36 square grid that depicts various special locations within the city. Players start by controlling a single temple that allows them to train either Priests or Zealots. Priests can preach to gain followers based on the population of each spot on the game board; however, they are vulnerable to be assassinated by an opponent's Zealot. Priests can also establish new temples throughout the city, which can also be desecrated and destroyed by an opponent's Zealot. Unit movement is dictated by multiple dice rolls equal to the number of temples you control.<br/><br/>Players can use divinity cards from their hand to change the outcome of certain scenarios. More powerful units like Prophets and Avatars can only be created by using specific divinity cards. By taking control of special spaces on the board players can also receive additional bonuses.<br/><br/>To win the game players must carefully choose a win condition to work towards.

It involved thousands of ships, stretched over hundreds of miles of ocean, and involved hundreds of convoy battles and single-ship encounters. During the struggle advantage switched back and forth between the U-boats and Allies as new weapons, tactics, and countermeasures were developed and implemented.<br/><br/>U-Boat Leader takes the Leader series to new depths, letting players control a group of U-boats on missions in the Atlantic. The core system of the game will be familiar to players of other Leader games, allowing them to quickly get into the game.<br/><br/>A major portion of the game is determining where to send your submarines. Do you concentrate your submarines in one or two areas to form wolfpacks or spread them out in the shipping lanes to increase the chances of finding contacts, or do you send them on special missions (such as mine-laying)? You can also spend Special Operations Points to support your submarines by adding search planes to help find enemy ships or by sending supply ships and subs (Milk Cows) to extend the endurance of the submarines.

The means to German victory is in the ground-attack Stukas and independent battalions of artillery, combat engineers, anti-aircraft (flak), and assault guns (StuGs) that can be attached to the regiments to devise the best tactical mix of forces to conquer Stalin's city.<br/><br/>While the German regiments were steadily reduced in strength and exhausted to impotence, dozens of untested, conscript Soviet rifle regiments and brigades were obliterated in the house-to-house fighting. Cards will provide crucial influential factors such as snipers, leader initiative, mine dogs, armored trains, and river flotilla warships.<br/><br/>In Objective: Stalingrad the German player commands up to twenty regiments of infantry, including panzer grenadier infantry, along with numerous independent units. There are four scenarios representing each of the major attacks launched by the Germans between 13 September and 11 November. There is also a multi-player campaign game. The smaller scenarios are designed to be played in three to four hours. (For a different approach, see Stalingrad: Verdun on the Volga. In VoV the German player can refight the four major historical attacks using up to nine primary maneuver units &ndash; divisions &ndash; at an operational level. The same scenario at that level can be finished in one to two hours.)<br/><br/>Objective: Stalingrad is about tactical choices for both the German and Soviet players. If you never had time to play Dana Lombardy's tactical company-level &quot;monster&quot; game Streets of Stalingrad, OS enables you to refight one of the most important battles of World War II in far less time.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": [], "categories": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Objective: Stalingrad", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "89228": {"mechanics": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic878249.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 89228, "yearpublished": 1986, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic878249_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Picsou"], "families": ["Sports: Bicycle / Cycling"], "description": "This French cycling game for children was given as a bonus in april 1986 with the French Picsou magazine.

Various cups are labeled as to the result, which may be an out or an extra-base hit. If the ball is still inbounds but not in a cup, it is a single. If it leaves the ballpark, then it is a homerun.<br/><br/>The controls of the pitcher allow the ball to be shot forth at varying speeds, moved with a magnet beneath the playing field, and dropped through a trapdoor so the batter is unable to hit it. The game rules describe six different &quot;pitches&quot; that can be thrown: a fastball, change-up, curveball, screwball, slider, and sinker. The game revolves around this element of the pitcher/hitter struggle. While it is very difficult to hit any pitch but a fastball or change-up, if the batter does not swing at anything else it is a ball, as in baseball. Various deceptions by the pitcher can be employed, such as opening the trapdoor while the ball is approaching the bat then closing it at the last moment so it will be a strike.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["Action / Dexterity", "Bluffing", "Sports"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Old School Ball Park", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 1}, "85201": {"mechanics": ["Area Movement", "Auction/Bidding", "Modular Board", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Tile Placement"], "usersrated": 16, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic829007.jpg", "wishing": 7, "owned": 2, "trading": 0, "id": 85201, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 1, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic829007_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Self-Published)"], "families": [], "description": "To endure in Atapuerca, your Homo Antecessors must evolve.

Designed to go along with the accompanying 28mm Fantasy Ranges the game features players maneuvering large blocks of miniature soldiers around the battlefield in search of victory.<br/><br/>Kings of War is a new concept for mass battle miniature wargaming &mdash; a game that is both easy to learn and fast to play! With few and simple rules, there is little to get in the way of the fun and slaughter. Kings of War is a challenging game of strategy, where you can pit your wits against your opponent without devoting half of your brain power to remember a plethora of convoluted rules.<br/><br/>And that&rsquo;s not all, the innovative turn structure allows you to play Kings of War using a time-keeping tool (like a stopwatch or a chess clock) to time your moves. As the seconds tick away, the pressure and excitement this adds makes 'Kings of War' unlike any other large-scale wargame you&rsquo;ve ever played before.<br/><br/>Units are given simple ratings such as 'Melee Attack', 'Defense' and 'Nerve' and then augmented with special abilities that characterize the different fantasy races that inhabit the world. In 2015, the &quot;beta&quot; rules were updated and a full ruleset was released. Abbreviated rules are downloadable from Mantic's website, and extracts (about 70%) from the full army lists for all factions are also available for download, called &quot;starter lists&quot;. Currently army lists exist for Elves, Dwarves, Kingdoms of Men (medieval humans), Basileans (clerical army with saints and angels), Forces of Nature (Treemen, Dryads and other assorted forest creatures), Forces of the Abyss (devils and demons), Abyssal (evil) Dwarves, Goblins, Orcs, Ogres, Twilight Kin (evil elves) and the Undead hordes. <br/>Additional factions lists are now available in the &quot;Uncharted Empires&quot; supplement: The Brotherhood (high medieval and mystical humans with elementals), Salamander (humanoid lizards), The Herd (satyrs... ok: beast-men), The League of Rhordia (fantasy renaissance humans and halflings), The Trident Realms of Neritica (tritons/ fishmen), The Empire of Dust (aegyptian undead... yes, kings from tombs), Night-Stalker Armies (spirits, ghosts and the like), Ratkin Armies (ska... er, scavenger ratmen) and the Varangur (chao...tic warriors).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.4737, "bayesaverage": 5.82911, "designers": ["Alessio Cavatore"], "categories": ["Book", "Fantasy", "Miniatures", "Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Kings of War", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "2745"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "469"}], "average": 7.73815, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.79836, "numcomments": 58}, "89301": {"mechanics": ["Hand Management"], "usersrated": 3, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic894700.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 5, "trading": 0, "id": 89301, "yearpublished": 1961, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic894700_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Capi\u00e9pa - Jeux \u00c9ducatifs"], "families": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!"], "description": "According to popular believe Wolfgang Kramer was supposed to be the first designer who introduced a points scoring track (Kramerleiste) around the board with his game Heimlich &amp; Co.<br/><br/>But this French game published back in 1961 already had such a points scoring track over 20 years earlier which makes this possibly the first game to implement this.<br/><br/>In the game each player plays a journalist trying to get the best stories whilst traveling from city to city on the board that depicts a map of the world.

Character Cards for each driver with his atributes: speed cards, first card, brake, attack and defense.<br/>4. Speed Cards; each driver has a set of four speed cards to determinate the movements and aceleration.<br/><br/>Drivers must move using Speed Cards. If you want play Child Mode you can use a D6. <br/>D6 is needed for attack and defense.<br/><br/>-Preparing the game<br/><br/>First you have to build a circuit and decide the total amount of laps to win the race. There must be at least one finish line and one special Road Card  where objects appear. Then each player chooses a driver (or randomly) and takes his Speed Cards. In the Driver Card is determined what is the first Speed Card to use (that is the acceleration rate somehow).<br/><br/>-The Race<br/>Player generally moves using a Speed Card that limits the maximun positions he can move on. He'll choose to move more or less, but allways within that limit.<br/><br/>-Start:<br/>Put Drivers on/beside finish line. Then each driver takes a random Speed Card and moves in turn. The first will be the<br/>younger player and then continue clockwise.<br/><br/>On the road:<br/>Each turn, every player must choose secretly one Speed Card; then Speed Cards are shown and drivers move.<br/><br/>Get objects:<br/>In the circiut there will be a Road Card with the object icon. When drivers pass on this, they get a Object Card from the Object Card deck. Drivers only can have one object card.<br/><br/>Attack/defense:<br/>When drivers are moving they could attack other players using Object Cards. The result is decided using Drivers Attack/Defense values, Object Attack/Defense values and a D6. Something like this:<br/><br/>Bowser attacks Mario with a Red Shell:<br/>  Bowser attack + Red Shell attack + D6 &gt; Mario defense + D6<br/><br/>Total attacker value must be greater than total defender value; if equal then nothing happens. Some objects could be used to add more Defense value (shells, bananas,...)<br/><br/>If the attack is successful the loser goes off the road, loses any Object Card and must wait one turn without moving. Then He must start using Drivers first Speed Card.<br/><br/>-Dangerous Curves:<br/>Some Road Cards have a special values like -1,-2,+1. These cards decrease Driver movement unless the Driver has a brake value bigger than 0. <br/>So if a player must go through a -2 curve and has a +1 brake value the movement decreases is only -1.

These companies produce and sell the same good (but in different styles and qualities) in 4 different regions (North/South America, Europe, Asia). Each game year the players will need to make important investment decisions (such as constructing or shutting down shops/factories worldwide, buying/selling shares, paying dividends), select a viable and efficient production plan, try to fulfill it and finally convert their production to sales. Also, they will have to look at the competition and through research try to push their efficiency even further. Simultaneously, local providers will also offer their products and &quot;steal&quot; a share of the market.<br/><br/>As in reality selling does not come easily. Each region will have a specific demand for the homogenous good (but in different quantities and styles) and a specific preference for quality and style. Considering these factors and of course the price, players will try to manipulate the markets. Demand is not totally known, however there is always a way to know better and possibly &quot;change&quot; the knowledge of the competitors at the last moment. Difficult decisions and a bit of luck will define the actual sales.<br/><br/>Players try to make profits not only for the money but also for their share price. Otherwise they will have to pay dividends if they want to keep the share price from declining. Loans are limited, costly and should not be taken lightly.<br/><br/>Scoring is unlocked by profitability and is measured by share price. Thankfully, no ownership changes are taking place in this game (it is assumed that the initial number of shares represent less than 50% of the company).<br/><br/>The managers' desicions include all the main aspects of running a business:<br/><br/>- How much to produce and where<br/>- How much to stock, sell and where<br/>- What price to set in each region<br/>- How many retailers to develop in each region<br/>- What style of goods to produce and what quality to maintain<br/>- How many workers will be employed and with what wage<br/>- How much will be spent on advertising (pay for more demand information?)<br/>- What mix of owned, private and public capital will be used<br/>- How production and sales will be spread worldwide<br/><br/>This is not an easy game to win and in fact, it is more difficult to win the better your opponents are.

It is an expanded version of sishi fen ('40 points') using two or more decks, and is related to zhao pengyou ('looking for friends'). All these games are collectively known as Sheng1 Ji2 (\u5347\u7ea7), which means &quot;raise level&quot; or &quot;promote&quot;. Tractor is widely popular in China, especially in Shanghai and south of the Yellow River where it has practically displaced the older single deck game.<br/><br/>The scores of the teams are expressed as card ranks. At the start of the game, each partnership has the lowest possible score, which is two. By winning games, a partnership can increase its score to a higher rank: three, four, five and so on. Above ten come jack, queen, king and ace. The objective is to achieve a score higher than ace - the partnership that achieves this wins the game.<br/><br/>In each hand, one team forms the declarers, sometimes known in Chinese as dang1 zhuang1 (\u5f53\u5e84), and the other team forms the opponents. In the first hand, either team can be the declarers, depending on who makes trumps. In subsequent hands, the team that won the previous hand is the declarers, and the other team is the opponents.<br/><br/>One member of the declarers' team is the starter, who has the advantage of taking the last cards in the deal, discarding some cards, and leading the first trick. While the declarers try to increase their score, the opponents' objective is to take at least 80 card points, in which case they become the declarers for the next deal.<br/><br/>Source: edited from Pagat, <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.pagat.com/kt5/tractor.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.pagat.com/kt5/tractor.html</a><br/><br/>", "minplayers": 4, "averageweight": 1.5, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["Card Game"], "name": "Bashi Fen", "playingtime": 90, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 6.625, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.49478, "numcomments": 4}, "89478": {"mechanics": ["Roll / Spin and Move", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Voting"], "usersrated": 66, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic888854.png", "wishing": 4, "owned": 178, "trading": 18, "id": 89478, "yearpublished": 2008, "maxplayers": 8, "numweights": 3, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic888854_t.png", "publishers": ["Buffalo Games"], "families": ["Mensa Select"], "description": "The game is played in rounds.

One faction plans to smuggle a dagger into the feast hall to &quot;open the king's heart to the realm&quot; at the right time, while the other faction hopes to give the king &quot;renewed motivation&quot; with a poisoned drink.<br/><br/>In The Last Banquet, each player is a guest at the feast and needs to help his faction reach its goal and ensure that this will truly be the king's last banquet. The game includes 25 role cards, each portraying a person on the front and listing that person's skills on the back. In addition to &quot;The Last Banquet&quot;, several other scenarios are provided in the rules that can be played with each of the roles. (GameHeads' Oliver Wolf notes, &quot;Playing time ranges from 30 minutes up to 90 minutes or more, with more people tending to need more time to play.&quot; Also, some scenarios involve more than two factions.) Obstacle cards provide challenges for players to overcome.<br/><br/>When a faction succeeds in its goal, all players who belong to that faction win the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 6, "averageweight": 1.8571, "bayesaverage": 5.53972, "designers": ["Michael Nietzer", "Oliver Wolf", "Britta Wolf"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Fantasy", "Humor", "Medieval", "Party Game"], "name": "The Last Banquet", "playingtime": 45, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "8279"}], "average": 5.70629, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.71281, "numcomments": 57}, "89493": {"mechanics": ["Grid Movement", "Tile Placement"], "usersrated": 16, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1164189.jpg", "wishing": 19, "owned": 22, "trading": 0, "id": 89493, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 3, "numweights": 3, "wanting": 3, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1164189_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Web published)", "nestorgames"], "families": ["3D Games", "Combinatorial"], "description": "Each player has thirteen hexagonal tiles, each of which has a unique arrangement of pointers to various edges.

The two separate battles shown in this game are named for the main objective city on each map, Mozhaysk to the west of Moscow, and Mtsensk to the south. Perhaps the most dramatic of the many desperate battles fought in front of Moscow, these two battles combined all the elements of the great struggle. The Germans have an excellent fighting machine but are short on fuel and time. They must capture their objectives on a tight schedule or snow and mud will end their offensive. The Soviets are down to the rearward remnants of their once immense armies. If the Soviets can avoid being encircled by the fast moving German forces, high quality reinforcements from the Far East may finally allow them to stop the German advance.<br/><br/>Historically, the Soviets stood fast at Mozhaysk, fighting heavily even on the old Napoleonic battlefield of Borodino. Like Napoleon, the Germans eventually took the field, but at great cost in time and manpower. Near Mtsensk Guderian&rsquo;s Panzer spearhead advancing north from Orel was ambushed by the Soviets thereby disrupting the German timetable. This gave the Soviet 6th Guards Rifle Division time to dig-in on the heights above Mtsensk thereby barring the way to Tula and Moscow.<br/> Roads to Moscow uses the same mechanics found in the acclaimed Roads to Leningrad game, featuring a chit draw for activation of formations. Both players quickly learn how to use their motorized units effectively for overruns, combined arms, and movement of reserves. The game includes special rules for Soviet rocket artillery, NKVD, and self-propelled gun units, and fuel supply shortages, and much more, all without overwhelming play of the game.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 12 hours<br/>Hex: 1.4km (Mozhaysk ), 1.2km (Mtsensk)<br/>Unit: Company to Battalion for most combat units, with Brigade &amp; Division HQs<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/>    Three counter sheets (528 5/8&quot; counters)<br/>    One 22&quot; x 34&quot; Mapsheet (front &amp; back printed)<br/>    4 Player Aid set-up cards<br/>    1 Charts &amp; Tables card<br/>    Rule book<br/>    Play book<br/>    1 ten-sided die<br/><br/>DESIGNER: Vance von Borries<br/>DEVELOPER: Mark Guttag<br/>ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

It is a light, fast-playing game of aerial dogfights between small numbers of jets. The objective of play is to defeat your opponent's air forces in close combat. The game is designed to be suitable for quick pickup games as well as long term campaigns.<br/><br/>As a print-and-play game, players are expected to print out and prepare the playing pieces with household craft tools (scissors, hobby knife, and ordinary glue). These playing pieces include jet fighters, movement and shooting tools, unique dice and (as an option) 3D paper models.<br/><br/>Game sessions begin by choosing a scenario. Each scenario establishes the starting positions and objectives of the fighter jets on each team. There are two sides in the war, the Rebels and the State. The scenarios are sometimes written to favor one side, to reflect the strengths and weaknesses of the opposing armies.<br/><br/>Once a scenario is selected, the players spend a certain number of &quot;army points&quot; to purchase their aircraft and outfit them with more experienced crews, weapons and special devices. Each jet uses its own record sheet, and during play the player controlling that jet is responsible for marking its current damage, ammo and other variables.<br/><br/>Gameplay proceeds by rounds, with each jet taking a turn according to its initiative score. Movement is handled using a fan-shaped &quot;movement key&quot; and rolling dice to determine the maximum turning angle for that instance. Attacks are handled with a &quot;range finder&quot; tool that is placed in front of the attacking jet and used to determine if any targets can be fired upon. Dice are rolled to determine the severity of damage.<br/><br/>Scenarios may be won by destroying the enemy team's jets, or by disabling or disarming the enemy team, forcing a forfeit. Some scenarios have special victory conditions, such as taking recon photos or bombing a ground target.<br/><br/>After a scenario, both sides are awarded some army points to further develop their air forces or replace ruined equipment. These changes may be carried over for use in the next scenario.<br/><br/>The base release for this game is the Air War Starter Set PDF. It contains all of the essential components, such as print-and-play dice, maneuvering and range-finding tools, speed tokens, smoke clouds, bombing targets and 2D jet fighter game pieces. This set includes two versions of the RG-6 Tigress, a fighter jet used by both sides during the war. The custom dice include a unique distribution of numbers, as well as keywords that are used in different situations.<br/><br/>The game is designed to be supplemented with individual vehicle packs containing new options and game pieces, as well as 3D paper model PDFs that can be assembled and used in place of the standard 2D jet fighter pieces. Expansions are planned that will introduce new jet types, heroic crew members, campaigns, ground vehicles and ships.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Dave Graffam"], "categories": ["Print & Play", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Solid State War", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 6.98333, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.40258, "numcomments": 2}, "89549": {"mechanics": ["Modular Board", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic883556.jpg", "wishing": 2, "owned": 1, "trading": 0, "id": 89549, "yearpublished": 1948, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic883556_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Cheerios"], "families": ["Characters: The Lone Ranger"], "description": "&quot;Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear...&quot;<br/><br/>In 1948 the Lone Ranger radio program made the following announcement, &quot;In celebration of the 15th year of this program you can get your very own model of the Lone Ranger Frontier Town.

Choose from 24 of the greatest tennis champions in history and pit them against each other in a fun, fast-paced game that isn&rsquo;t packed full of tables and charts. Instead, the entire game is designed to get you thinking about strategy right from the first strike of the ball. Each player in the game is rated for various Strokes such as 1st Serve, Backhand, Forehand Volley and Touch, from a low of F (a terrible shot for a pro player), to AA (one of the legendary Strokes in tennis history). Play Strategy cards to increase your scoring chances, defend against your opponent&rsquo;s Strokes, or try a variety of Tactics (Crowd the Net, Pick up the Pace, etc.) to shake things up.<br/><br/>The fun comes not only from the wide variety of Strategy cards in play at any particular time, but also from the effects different cards have on each other. Do you risk hitting a Cannonball Serve, knowing that your opponent might have secretly played a card that negates it? Can you keep using Go for the Lines as a Tactic, knowing that you might miss, and hurt your scoring chances? And depending on which players are involved, the strategic decisions each set only multiply. As you master the Basic game and move on to the Intermediate and Advanced games, we add the possibility of a Set ending earlier, more Random Events, Tiebreakers, and even Fatigue and Injuries, for those who want more realism, without much increase in complexity.<br/><br/>Stage your own tournaments, find out which courts best fit your style, and serve up some of the greatest Strokes the world has ever seen!

Wounds are represented by randomly drawn wound counters that may result in anything from a small leg graze to a belly wound that will get worse during the course of the game to a direct head shot that takes out a man immediately.<br/><br/>The initial release of the game is titled; Outlaws: Adventures in the Old West - Episode One. Each episode will  include the base rules which run to 12 pages and include many illustrations on all aspects of play. There is also a Shootout and Adventure booklet containing scenarios.<br/><br/>In Episode One there are 10 maps - each will print on a single US Letter or A4 page and will tile with each other to create a large range of environments in which scenarios are set. Episode one contains all you need to play.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["David Murray (II)"], "categories": ["American West", "Print & Play", "Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Outlaws: Adventures in the Old West", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.80952, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.91906, "numcomments": 20}, "89627": {"mechanics": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Hex-and-Counter"], "usersrated": 14, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic884893.jpg", "wishing": 5, "owned": 47, "trading": 0, "id": 89627, "yearpublished": 2011, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 3, "wanting": 4, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic884893_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Victory Point Games"], "families": ["Napoleonic 20"], "description": "Napoleon's Final Campaign: Germany, 4-6 September, 1813<br/><br/>Napoleonic 20 #11 (Germany 20 #3) Expansion Kit<br/><br/>Designer Lance McMillan offers a fascinating Expansion Kit for Grossbeeren 20, placing you in command of either the Coalition forces or the French army.

All the non-royal pieces retain their moves and capturing abilities. The queen becomes a valkyrie, with the additional power of transporting a king to safety by taking its place on the board. Knights become Forest oxen, with great horns that can kill in a neighboring square. Pawns become minor pieces, giving up their promotion ability to do so. And kings must &quot;consult&quot; before doing anything. The king moves and captures like any friendly piece it starts the turn next to. Each player has 2 of each type of piece, including kings, and 10 pawns.

A large branch (and some say the remains of a pulley) hung directly above the pit. He recruited friends and, armed with shovels, they began to dig. They found a solid floor of oak-logs every 10 feet for a considerable depth. Sea-water floodied the pit and prevented them from digging further. What still lies buried over 100 feet below the surface depends on who you ask: Captain Kidd&rsquo;s treasure, Incan gold, Shakespeare&rsquo;s lost manuscripts, the Holy Grail, or perhaps nothing at all.<br/><br/>Over the years more men brought their ingenuity to bear on the problem, but failed. The failures were due to lack of modern machinery and ignorance; each excavation being stopped by water and lack of funds. A new century brings new technology and every hope that the mystery of Oak Island will soon finally be put to rest.<br/><br/>Oak Island is a board game for 3-5 players attempting to get to the bottom of the mysterious treasure pit on Oak Island. The amateur treasure hunters bring their resources to bear on the problem of excavating the pit, and compete with each other to publish their findings and theories using an innovative scoring system.<br/><br/>Players take turns picking up a row or column of resource cards from the card display. Action cards set in the display are triggered when a player picks it up. Machinery cards in the display do not refresh until the next round. A round ends when a player picks up the Treasure Trove License card, triggering an excavation.<br/><br/>The Money Pit consists of consecutive tiles that are revealed as they are excavated jointly by the players. In order to excavate a tile, the symbols shown on it must be matched on resource cards invested secretly and simultaneously by the players. Each resource card has an abstract monetary value ($, $$, or $$$); the players are ranked in order of investment, with the one who invested least playing first in the next round. The player who invested most gets first pick of the assets (clues, machinery, and victory points) collected by the venture.<br/><br/>Another source of VPs are the theories a player can publish. A theory consists of two or more clues joined together. A complete theory is any size rectangle (2xY) while a partial theory is any other assembly of clue pieces. Publishing a theory during the game consists of a player revealing one or more new clue pieces to form a new theory, or revealing one ore more new clue pieces and reinterpreting the clues of the same colour in an existing public theory (theirs or another players) in order to form a new theory. Clues that don&rsquo;t make it into the new theory cost the player points. The first clue played of any given colour are worth bonus points. Adjacent clues of the same colour within a theory are worth additional points. Complete theories earn a player 2 points per clue, excluding blank ones - incomplete ones earn a player 1 point per clue, including blank ones.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Yves Tourigny"], "categories": ["Exploration", "Puzzle"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Oak Island", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "85607": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic974041.png", "wishing": 0, "owned": 2, "trading": 0, "id": 85607, "yearpublished": 1995, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic974041_t.png", "publishers": ["Jumbo", "Lund & Associates", "Spear's Games"], "families": ["Animals: Rabbits"], "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>The magic game of floating fun!<br/><br/>Add rabbits to the floating figure to test Floatini's powers to their limit.<br/><br/>From the Introduction:<br/>The Great Floatini is famed throughout the world for his amazing magical powers.

The year is 1870 and the Industrial Revolution occurred decades earlier than in our own world. Technology is far advanced, and in many cases, unrecognisable, which has led to the development of fantastic naval vessels, hulking land ships and terror from the skies in the form of airships and war balloons.<br/><br/>Dystopian Wars is designed to ensure a fun game with a large selection of models in a couple of hours. We are big fans of Steam Punk and Victoriana, so we jumped at the chance of creating a naval warfare game along similar lines to our Uncharted Seas and Firestorm Armada games - but encapsulating these interesting genres. Dystopian Wars incorporates Naval, Aerial and Land Models from the outset, so that you can set up battles and scenarios in any combat setting. Games can be played in each genre of warfare OR using a combination of ALL models.<br/><br/>Spartan Games will supply highly detailed, high quality resin and metal miniatures with which you can roam the high seas, scour the smog filled skies of Dystopian Wars for enemy flying ships, or doggedly defend the cities and countryside of your home nation. These three branches of the military use the same core rules for movement and combat, with varying abilities and statistics.<br/><br/>Our fast play rules are optimised for large fleet actions, so you can get as many miniatures on the table as you want, and still get an enjoyable game in one evening. Dystopian Wars is also ideal for multiplayer games, because you get to activate individual squadrons of miniatures from one player to the next. The rules allow for the use of a deck of 52 Game Cards that add an exciting element of randomness to each game. You can play without them, but they improve the overall game play and inject some additional eccentric Victorian atmosphere.<br/><br/>Dystopian Wars is our third game to be built using our D6-based core rules engine and shares elements with the science fiction space combat of Firestorm Armada and the fantasy naval combat of the Uncharted Seas. Dystopian Wars builds on the same successful game ethos.<br/><br/>We are excited about the development of Dystopian Wars - it is an entertaining and violent game, putting you in command of huge Land Vessels, Giant Robots, Impressive Airships and Rugged Naval Ships. Your strategies and choices of fleet construction determine the margin of your victories or defeat. Whether you choose to focus on land, sea or in the air, you have every choice available to you to outmanoeuvre, harass and destroy your opponent.<br/><br/>You command one of the great imperial powers of Dystopian Wars, you can defend your territories from foreign incursion, or you can conquer the world.

While Utah seemed relatively easy, it was there, at Omaha Beach, where the Germans came closest to derailing the greatest sea-borne invasion of all time. Behind both beaches, two famous airborne divisions were scattered all over the countryside, and fought by twos and twenties to accomplish a semblance of their missions.

A WFF (pronounced &quot;woof&quot;) is a expression in a system of mathematical logic that is roughly equivalent to a sentence in English prose. In the WFF games, certain sequences of letters are considered WFFs, and players attempt to arrange an increasing number of letter dice to create ever-longer true sentences, or WFFs.<br/><br/>In Shake-a-WFF, the two players practice recognition and construction of WFFs. Players use six capital-letter dice, six small-letter dice, and a Shake-a-WFF playing mat (one mat each). Each player begins with three dice, and seeks to create a WFF using the letters they've rolled. Each round, players add or subtract a die from their shaking set according to whether they successfully created a WFF in the previous round or not. The first player to create a WFF with eight dice wins the game.<br/><br/>In Count-a-WFF, two or more players simultaneously view the same set of rolled dice to try to create the longest single WFF from the letters rolled.

Each type of building provides its owner a special power: Forts are immune to boulders, Towers earn an extra victory token when defended, and so on. The attacked player then attacks someone else until everyone has attacked and been attacked once, then a new round begins.<br/><br/>As soon as someone claims his eighth victory token, he wins the game. For a more difficult game, or to balance play between adults and children, the minimum distance of an attack can be increased from one foot to two feet.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.2, "bayesaverage": 5.51336, "designers": ["Rebekah Bissell"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Action / Dexterity", "Children's Game", "Dice", "Fantasy"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Knock Your Blocks Off", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 15, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "9959"}], "average": 5.68209, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.31818, "numcomments": 22}, "90088": {"mechanics": ["Memory"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 90088, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "", "publishers": ["Edith Schlichting Company"], "families": [], "description": "Get your winter clothes together: Hat, scarf, gloves, bag, socks, right and left boot, but make sure that you get them in your color, and even more that you don't get the broken ones!<br/><br/>The wooden disks depicting these items in one of six colors each, one color for each player plus one brown, broken version of each, lie face down on the table, and each player must try to collect all items of his color.

It is played on a terrain model using miniatures representing single vehicles, infantry sections, and crew-served weapons. Players adopt the roles of commanders of platoon or company sized groups. The game requires at least a neutral player in the role of controller, who sets the scenario, supervises play and resolves disputes.

In this game, the two day-night spaces, next to the number, on the inside are considered one space. The the next most outside space is the number space. After this comes the colored space. Outside most is a light or dark space. Each of these spaces is considered able to hold one piece in this game. As players place their pieces on the board, in a space, the first piece is put on the day-night space, the second on the number space, the third on the color space, and the last piece is placed on the light or dark space outer section.<br/><br/>Overview of gameplay:<br/>Players alternate turns putting their pieces on the board into one of four spaces on the outer track. A piece either immediately comes from their reserve, or it is taken from the board and put into their reserve and then played, if the player as no pieces in their reserve at the start of their turn. After a player places a piece on the board, pieces may end up sliding towards the inside part of the outer track, and then the board is checked for scoring conditions. If there are scoring conditions, pieces will be removed from the board and put into reserve(s) and scoring occurs. After this more pieces may end up sliding towards the inside part of the outer track and the scoring process is repeated.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player scores 6 points (player's figure hits the last space on the bluestone track), gets 10 pieces in a row, or is the last remaining player.

Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomly chosen that players may add to their specific decks. Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards. In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors; or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon.<br/><br/>A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters together. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types so players must take this into account when they choose what to buy.<br/><br/>Rather than buying puny Victory Points, players will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. On their turn, players may choose to visit either the dungeon or the village. Plays can purchase other cards for their deck or level up their heroes in the village. If they instead go to the dungeon, they play their heroes, weapons, items, and spells to defeat any one of the available monsters. The deeper the monster is in the dungeon, the more light is needed or the monster will gain power. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards. In addition to this players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions. The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it. The player with the most victory points in their deck is the winner.<br/><br/>From the publisher:<br/><br/>Thunderstone returns with Dragonspire!

They know their nuke will wipe out all traces of their crimes when the Countdown ends, but what of the small chance that a survivor escapes with the Hermit and his Intel?<br/><br/>Enter the MBI Black Ops squad, a team of 5 deadly Soldiers under the command of the ruthless Chrissy. Will they pick off any lucky survivors before the Countdown wipes out the rest of them? Or will they fall victim to the heroes much like the horde of Undead surrounding them all?<br/><br/>Introducing a new playable character, CHRISSY: the fair-haired Controller of the Black Ops squad. Ant was once his greatest student until Chrissy's thirst for innocent blood turned the young soldier against his team and into a life of isolation. Now armed with an even deadlier group of 5 Black Ops Soldiers, Chrissy has been sent into the heart of Zombie-infested Endicott with a simple mission from the heads of MBI: kill everyone and everything before it can escape the end of the Nuclear Countdown.<br/><br/>Hidden within the play deck amongst the flesh-craving Undead are the five Black Ops Soldiers. Uncover one, and become marked for execution. Try to fend off the Soldier with all your might until the sneaky assassins slither back into hiding within the remainder of the deck. Beware, once you are marked you run the risk of being executed sooner than you think! Take a breather from combating the Undead in order to attempt to remove the marks; but don't spend too much time to yourself - every attempt to remove a mark, whether successful or not, will cost you some of your slain Zombies.<br/><br/>When the time comes, Chrissy will send out the command to his Soldiers to EXECUTE! Roll the die when the command is drawn; the matching marks are instantly executed and players take damage (potentially fatal, if you have a hard time removing your marks). But that's not all - sometimes the Execute commands will allow more than one Soldier to execute their marks, spelling certain doom for any players who have unwillingly collected a variety of marks from several different Soldiers. If you fall victim to one of the Soldiers, respawning is no longer an option. You are instantly killed and any Cure cards you were holding become compromised with the Solders' evil decoy-deception. Now your allies must roll a successful Cure Retrieval value TWICE before they can take the Cure card and win the game.<br/><br/>Despite their advantages in both stealth and strength, the Black Ops Soldiers are still only human. If you can manage to do so, killing one will reward you dearly - not in points and not in monetary value, but with the knowledge that you and your comrades can walk the desolate streets of an apocalyptic Endicott with a bit more safety.

When rolling the &lsquo;Eye&rsquo; symbol you do not move and should instead draw one of your Flash-backwards card (later in the game Flash-forwards and Flash-sideways cards are used). Your &lsquo;Flash&rsquo; cards usually instruct you to increase or decrease your Skill points or gain Fate points.<br/><br/>When you visit certain locations, and have encounters, the marker on the story track will be steadily advanced. When the story track reaches certain points, changes will be made to the game; for example the Encounter Deck being used may change to another one, or certain Friends counters may become de-activated.<br/>The story track will also instruct you and the other players to move to one of the separate game boards or a different game track on the main board.<br/><br/>As you progress through the various stages of the game, the Encounter decks will continually change so that you meet people and find items from the different seasons of the LOST saga. Also your chosen character&rsquo;s skill points will gradually improve making future challenges easier, and you will gain all important Fate points.<br/><br/>You will receive Mystery Counters as rewards. Each of the various mysteries depicted (for example Jacob, the Numbers) is made up of a set of 5 cards. If you can collect a complete set, they can be traded in for additional Fate points.<br/><br/>Eventually the action will move to the centre track on the game board where one of the players will be chosen to succeed Jacob.

But lately reports of sightings of Nessie have been increasing.<br/><br/>&quot;Such reports naturally have drawn such reporters as the attractive Belinda Viewing from New York, the half-Belgian Claude McMirror, the clever Filosa Sharp, as well as her Londoner competitor Jack Nesstee, and even Nils the Blitzen from Denmark to the Loch.  Equipped with the most modern equipment and techniques, these daring reporters have traveled to Scotland, in order to capture the elusive Nessie on film for their newspapers.<br/><br/>&quot;But the 5 will experience some surprises . . .&quot;<br/><br/>In Loch Ness, players compete to get pictures of Nessie.  In turn order, players place or move their photographers on the board as they try to anticipate the movement of the Loch Ness monster.  The movement of the monster is determined randomly by drawing move cards from the first three players, each card having a number from 1 to 5.  The cards are not revealed until after the photographers have been placed.  When they are revealed, the monster moves the total number of spaces and players score points based on the value of their photographers placed in the area where Nessie emerged.  In addition, the players whose photographers were directly in front of Nessie select photo cards that will award points at the end of the game, especially if sets are created.<br/><br/>Beginning in the second round, players will select an action space each round that gives them a unique power to use for for the round.  Placement also gets more challenging from the second round onward as a player is required to move a photographer, perhaps opening up spots for opponents.  Each round, some of the players do have a limited knowledge of how Nessie will move each round.  When a player draws a movement card before positioning his photographers, he is allowed to look at it, giving him one-third of the movement for that round.  However, movement varies tremendously and only three players draw movement cards each round.<br/><br/>The game ends after the round in which a mini Nessie figure reaches space 65 on the score track.  This figure moves the same number of spaces as the main Nessie figure in the game board each round.  The player with the most points, scored during the game and from the photo cards at the end, wins the game.

In the Breton language &quot;Roue Breizh&quot; means &quot;King of Brittany&quot; (Roue is pronounced &quot;Rou&eacute;&quot;, the old pronunciation of the French word Roi or King). The game comes with an educational booklet setting out the history of what was, to the medieval mind, a mystical land associated with the knights of the Round Table and the legendary forest of Broc&eacute;liande.<br/><br/>In this game, players play the feudal lords of Brittany who have survived the fall of Rome (or have fled from their original homeland: Britain) and now face barbarian invasions from the sea and the encroachments of the Frankish kingdom from the east. The Breton lords gradually settle and connect up their different domains, establishing towns and defending themselves against the terrible Vikings and Northmen. The aim of the game is to found ever larger baronies, counties and duchies, whether on one's own, or in combination with the domains of an ally. At the end of the game, one of these lords will be crowned King of Brittany: the &quot;Roue Breizh&quot;!<br/><br/>Mechanisms: Kingdoms are made and unmade, alliances are formed at will. There's no elimination of players. Instead, players are given the chance to form alliances, and may freely give and receive lands as they make or break alliances at the end of each turn. During a turn, members of the same alliance are not allowed to attack each other. Being a member of a strong alliance will allow each player in the alliance to have a better dice-roll in times of conflict. Some players are also members of the Council of Broc&eacute;liande, which gives its members more power, but also - inevitably - the obligation to redistribute resources and to promote the development of other players instead! Gaming enthusiasts will certainly enjoy the fact that &quot;Roue Breizh&quot; gives a decisive advantage to team-play, through the principle of rotating &quot;coalitions&quot;. Between each round of play, the formation and re-formation of teams gives rise to complex interactions between the players as they negotiate the terms of their alliance.<br/><br/>(This is an amended version of the summary published on the Tric Trac website, in French).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 3.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Marc Varoujan"], "categories": ["Fighting", "Medieval", "Negotiation"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Roue Breizh", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 90, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 4.85714, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.45686, "numcomments": 2}, "85999": {"mechanics": ["Paper-and-Pencil", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "usersrated": 20, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1364005.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 34, "trading": 0, "id": 85999, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 10, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1364005_t.jpg", "publishers": ["moses.
