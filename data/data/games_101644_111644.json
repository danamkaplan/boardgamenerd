Elements like Jokers and the Charleston which were part of various card games found their way into the game. Each year a Scoring Card of hands and rule changes is released.

As a clan leader you decide on the well-being of your clan during the Stone Age.

With the help of these skills, you will harvest enough food to feed your clan and spread it far enough to reach new hunting areas.<br/><br/>In a game of The First Sparks you are always confronted with many decisions: Which technology cards offer you the biggest advantages? When is the right time to spread your clan on the game board? Which hunting areas will grant the most food?

At the start of the game, the players decide if they would like to play either the 100 Days or the 100 People path.  All player tokens are then placed at the start of this path.  Each player in turn will roll the die and move the number of spaces on the die.    The 100 Days path has 100 different dates on the spaces, while the 100 people has 100 different people listed on the path.  The player then must state one or more facts about the person or the date that they landed on, and if they are correct then they would get a point.  For example, if they land on December 14, 1782, the player would get a point if they state that The British pulled out of Charleston South Carolina.  Once all players finish the selected path then all of the player pawns are then placed back at the start for phase two, the Question phase.  The players then move around the track again, only this time when they land on a space they get to answer a multiple choice question from the book that corresponds to their space that they landed on.   Every correct answer gets one point.   Once all players cross the finish line of the question phase then the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["American Revolutionary War", "Trivia"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "200 Steps to Freedom", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 120, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "106782": {"mechanics": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Dice Rolling", "Modular Board"], "usersrated": 9, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1086263.jpg", "wishing": 4, "owned": 10, "trading": 0, "id": 106782, "yearpublished": 2012, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 1, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1086263_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Print & Play Productions"], "families": [], "description": "The Great City of Andalanshar is once again leaderless.

The battle was the culmination of a quarter-century of political and military maneuvering by Otto von Bismarck, aimed at enabling Prussia to supplant Austria-Hungary as the dominant state of the coalescing German nation.<br/><br/>The battle is presented using the folio line&rsquo;s Musket &amp; Saber system: brigade-sized units, one-fifth-mile hexes, 90-minute turns, 280 counters. The Austro-Hungarian army, chastened by a week of minor defeats, was entrenched a long line covering the fortress of K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz. It occupied a central position facing three converging Prussian armies. To win, the Prussians must sweep the Austrians off the field (as they did historically), while the Austrians must maintain a presence on the field to justify their continued claim to political primacy. The game emphasizes the differences between the armies in doctrine, weapons and morale. The Prussian triumph was born of more than just the famous needle-gun: their infantry used flexible organization and tactics to mass men quickly at the decisive point, while the Austrians used a throwback to Napoleonic column formations due to a misreading of the lesson from an earlier engagement. The Prussian artillery is outclassed by the superb Austrian guns, but can be dangerous if used properly. The Austrian cavalry is superior as well, but horsed charges were already an anachronism.

In the end, the grand attractions are what will impress the crowds and bring about euphoric headlines in the newspapers!<br/><br/>To set up Coney Island, each player takes two money tiles, a random building material and a player board, covering most of the spaces on that board with showmen tiles. At the start of each turn, a player receives income. At the beginning of the game a player's income is one VP, one money and one randomly drawn building material; as the game progresses, the player can remove showmen tiles to uncover VP, money and material spaces, thereby boosting his income.

Each player commands a combat force composed of one or more sub-commands. These sub-commands are maneuvered via picking Command Chits at random; When a Command Chit is picked, that sub-command is then activated.

Combat in the game is quasi-tactical. Units fire at enemy targets at range. Additionally, the Coalition player has access to various types of fire support, such as airstrikes. However, owing to the chaotic nature of the battle, fire support as well as various reinforcements appear at random. The Al Qaeda player has the advantage of his units being deployed face down so that the Coalition player must use ISR (Intelligence-Surveillance-Reconnaissance) to reveal them.

The main German offensive, dubbed the Sichelschnitt (razor cut), struck through the lightly defended Ardennes Forest and emerged at Sedan. Alarmed at the prospect of a German breakout here, and the collapsing defense at Sedan, the French ordered an immediate counter-attack. General Heinz Guderian, however, had already ordered the bulk of the German panzer formations to breakout from the Sedan bridgehead, and ordered the Gross Deutchland Regiment, with a supporting Kampfgruppe formed from the 8th Panzer Division to take and hold the high ground at Stonne, to guard the German's bridgehead over the Meuse River and expanding flank. For the first, and only, time during the 1940 campaign, Guderian's Panzers ran into the premier French tank, the Char B1-Bis, as the French counter attacked to reduce the Sedan bridgehead.

German forces pushed out of the Low Vosges forests to capture Wingen-sur-Moder, situated along the road net needed for Operation Nordwind. The attacking enemy forces struck Wingen at the first light of day and rapidly moved through the village. In the confusion that followed, Company A lost communications with Companies B and C, and for a time the Company was without radio contact with the Battalion CP in the Kirchberg. Within the company perimeter confusion made it difficult for the platoon leaders and platoon sergeants to get their men organized. Nearly every squad was on its own. Their reaction to the sudden attack was left to the judgment of the individual squad leaders. By 0900 hours the Germans had captured and occupied the town, the high ground to the northeast of town, and established a bridgehead on the south bank of the Moder River. They immediately went about establishing a perimeter defense around the village then prepared to continue their attack southward toward Saverne.<br/><br/>During the first days of January 1945 German forces pushed out of the Low Vosges forests to capture the towns that lay along the snow-covered route of attack. One of these towns was Wingen, along the Moder River. American units there were initially caught by surprise as battle-hardened troopers from the 6th SS Mountain Division stormed in and captured the town. American reinforcements were soon pouring in from the west and the south and despite bitter fighting, by January 5th the German offensive had been brought to a standstill. Lacking exits from the Vosges, planned armored reserves stood idle and Operation Nordwind ended in failure. Wingen sits in a small valley along the Moder River between Bitche to the north and Saverne to the south. Described in the following bucolic terms, &ldquo;...the village and the surrounding area looked very much like a winter scene one might expect to find on a Christmas card back home. Smoke rising from a few chimneys made the houses appear warm and inviting...&rdquo; Wingen would erupt on 3 January 1945 and become the focal-point of Operation Nordwind.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 5.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Larry Winslow"], "categories": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Wargame", "World War II"], "name": "ATS: Nordic Twilight", "playingtime": 180, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.86667, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 2.62636, "numcomments": 5}, "107357": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling"], "usersrated": 6, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1231218.jpg", "wishing": 9, "owned": 25, "trading": 0, "id": 107357, "yearpublished": 2011, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 1, "wanting": 4, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1231218_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Assault Publishing"], "families": [], "description": "Hind Commander deals with interesting, but difficult field &ndash; helicopter actions over the modern frontlines.

The number of points gained by the active player's team is determined by both the number of correct answers and by how close the team's guess were. (The system for point allocation is a bit complicated; the game comes with a cardboard dial for determining the number of points.) Then the next player in team white has to answer questions and so on, until one of the tams reaches a  previously established numbers of points (40, 50 or 60 points).<br/><br/>Question cards come in three different types: &quot;for all ages&quot;, &quot;young players usually have an advantage&quot;, and &quot;more experienced players usually have an advantage&quot;, which allows the players to adjust the level of difficulty. Each player also randomly draws two joker cards, which can be played after the general question has been announced (but before the specific questions are asked) and is then discarded. Joker cards also come in three different types: one allows you to pass on your question to a different member of your team (the &quot;I'd rather you answer&quot; joker), one allows you to take over a question from a member of your team (&quot;I'm an expert in this area, I want to answer this&quot;), and one allows all the team members to answer a question together.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 4, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Peter Labusch", "Franz Scholles"], "categories": ["Party Game", "Trivia"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Teampower", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 45, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 6.16667, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 3.65908, "numcomments": 1}, "107362": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 0, "image": "", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 107362, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "", "publishers": ["(Unpublished)"], "families": ["Flowers"], "description": "Unpublished game.<br/>Has won a German award (Deutscher Lernspielpreis 2011) in the category &quot;Unpublished games&quot;.

They are trying to stop Professor Mad, who is wreaking havoc in several places in town (professor's laboratory, zoo, museum, TV studio, open-air concert stage, toy store, detective's headquarters, fast-food restaurant). In order to stop him, they have to complete assignments in all these places. If a player completes an assignment, he/she earns a medal. If an assignment fails, Professor Mad gets the medal instead. The players win if they have more medals than the professor at the end of the game.<br/>  <br/>The electronic pen is used to discover the main game board and the eight location boards. Tapping components with the pen triggers an audio explanation of the components, and the pen also tells the players the English words for the objects whose depiction they have tapped. An info button triggers hints and rules explanations. The pen also functions as a game master and a die: when all players have registered their player tokens, the pen chooses a start player. The active player taps his token with the pen, and the pen tells him how many spaces to move. It also announces three locations as the current targets for assignments. If a player reaches one of these locations, he takes the corresponding location board and tries to complete the assignment. Assignments include things like tapping a correct number or color code, or musical instruments. All the instructions are given by the pen and the players have to associate the English words they hear with the corresponding pictures. When an assignment is completed, the pen announces a new target location.

The board contains the following types of spaces:<br/>Event spaces and special spaces: The player draws a card from the corresponding stack. Event cards must be played immediately, special cards can be kept until needed.<br/>Attraction spaces: The player receives an asset card of the corresponding tourist attraction. Different attractions have cards worth different amounts of money.<br/>Language spaces: The player gets a language card, which they have to learn during the game. Each language card contains two different words or phrases in German and Spanish.<br/>Metro spaces can be used either as a shortcut to a different metro space, or as an event, special or language space (player's choice).<br/>Bank spaces: On a bank space, the player can exchange asset and language cards for money. To do so, they must have learned the language cards. During an exchange attempt, one asset card and two language cards are submitted. The German words are read out, and if the active player correctly translates them to Spanish, he/she receives the amount of money specified on the asset card.

These &quot;U-cards&quot; can be played before the player begins explaining words, and include abilities such as:<br/>- &quot;First letter&quot;: You are allowed to say the first letter of the word;<br/>- &quot;Additional minute&quot;: You are given one additional minute to explain;<br/>- &quot;Replace a player&quot;: You can change the player who is going to explain the words - this lets competing teams gain an advantage by preventing good players from participating. <br/>- &quot;With closed eyes&quot;  - Have you ever tried to explain something without seeing others?<br/>- &quot;Robbery&quot;: You can guess the word of another team and steal their points<br/><br/>The game contains 200 cards with words.  Each card has 10 tasks, so the game comes with 2,000 words and phrases.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 4, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Timofey Bokarev", "Dmitry Kibkalo", "Artem Zubov"], "categories": ["Action / Dexterity", "Party Game", "Travel", "Word Game"], "name": "Crocodile", "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 6.33333, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 2.0548, "numcomments": 0}, "107551": {"mechanics": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Grid Movement"], "usersrated": 3, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1084616.jpg", "wishing": 4, "owned": 5, "trading": 0, "id": 107551, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 2, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1084616_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Fantasy World, Inc.", "Hobby World", "Igrology"], "families": ["Chess Games"], "description": "From publisher:<br/><br/>&quot;Chaos Chess.

It was expected to be a normal working day when suddenly the upper galleries of the gold and copper mine collapsed, causing the miners to be trapped for months.

To be successful, you and your team must meet all the government&rsquo;s mandatory health, safety and environment (HSE) standards, acquire the necessary gears, and endeavor to avoid danger zones. Remember, the perils and rewards are high - just when you think you are about to enter the chamber to rescue a trapped miner, your mission might suffer a setback as the other rescue team progresses.

Each player begins with 7 cards from one of the 2 decks and must attempt to play his cards to a community board.  The board is divided into 2 sections, and players must play cards only to their designated spaces on the board, only when adjacent to other placed cards, and only into 1 section per turn.  Players may choose to (or may occasionally be forced to) draw simultaneously from both the Book Deck (which has more of the same cards that were dealt initially) and the Providence Deck (which enables special placements).  Some cards are setbacks when drawn, while others allow opponents to save each other from the setbacks (and benefit themselves in the process.)<br/><br/>The game can be played in either of 2 ways.  The Standard Version contains a few extra cards which force play to the board and which create blockages on the board that can be removed only through cooperative effort.  This extra layer of complexity provides opportunity for cooperative play and additional strategy which is not available in the much simpler Family Version of the game (which is better suited for children and casual gamers.)  In addition to removing a few cards from the decks, the Family Version allows for a different ending to the game: where the Standard Version is resolved in a Discard Phase that awards victory to the lowest scorer, the Family Version is won simply when any player goes out, having played all their cards on their turn.<br/><br/>Words of Wisdom: the Game has an overtly Biblical theme.  The numbered board spaces represent the 66 books of the Bible, and the cards in the Book Deck represent individual books of the Bible.  The cards in the Providence Deck channel Bible-based occurrences such as Trials, Miracles, Prophecies, and Parables.  Nevertheless, the theme is as light and non-intrusive as the game play is: the rules state that no familiarity with the Bible is necessary to play, enjoy, or win the game.  Likewise, there are no specific teachings or stories told through the game itself.  If the game attempts anything spiritual, it is only to familiarize the players with the names and order of the books that make up the Bible.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Stephen Reeder"], "categories": ["Educational", "Religious"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Words of Wisdom: The Game", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 20, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "107635": {"mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Tile Placement"], "usersrated": 206, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1102111.jpg", "wishing": 114, "owned": 582, "trading": 30, "id": 107635, "yearpublished": 2012, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 28, "wanting": 26, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1102111_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Queen Games"], "families": ["Cities: Cairo", "Country: Egypt", "Queen Yellow Wave Box Series"], "description": "In the bustling market of Cairo, traders build their stalls and try to entice customers with attractive goods, with each customer bringing money that the trader can then use to expand that stall or establish new stalls.<br/><br/>To set up Kairo, players first take turns placing three colored stalls (out of six) on the game board.

Additionally, this player can choose to play one or more market barker cards to &quot;call&quot; the customer past one or more stalls, presumably to bring the customer to that player's own stall.

The 74th Division of the Chinese 57th Army (nicknamed as &quot;Growling Tiger Division&quot;) was ordered to defend Changde and fate will decide the outcome of the battle.<br/><br/>The Battle of Changde began on 18th November 1943 when the Imperial Japanese 11th Army under the command of Isamu Yokoyama already approached the strongholds in the suburbs of Changde with around 20,000 men under three divisions. The Japanese 116th Division in the northwest began to attack the Chinese defenders at Huangtu Mountain and the Hefu Mountain while the Japanese 68th Division in the east began to attack Shigongmiao and Xinmin Bridge (XinminQiao). The Japanese 3rd Division in the south advanced towards the southern bank of Yuan River after they took Deshan. On 25th November 1943 these three Japanese Divisions were outside Changde City.<br/><br/>The Chinese garrisons in the fortifications inside the city near the eastern, northern and western gates engaged the Japanese Forces continuously without any rest with the Japanese having firepower supremacy in both air force bombardments and artillery fires. On 28th November 1943, Japanese General Yokoyama launched simultaneous attacks on all the four gates. Despite the Chinese 57th Division fought valiantly, the city wall had fallen.<br/><br/>At the same time, reinforcements from the Chinese 19th Division were advancing towards Hefu and the 190th Division had begun to counterattack from the east. At this very moment, the overall commander of the defending garrison at Changde, Division Commander Yu Ching Man issued his last telegraph to Sun Lianzhong in this battle. &quot;No more ammunition, without reinforcement, the city has fallen.&quot;<br/><br/>Sun was the deputy commander of the Sixth Front On 1st December 1943, reinforcements from the Chinese 10th Army have captured positions at Deshan and the Chinese 3rd Division and the 10th Division were approaching from the southern bank to help the Changde garrison though they were unable to contact with the 57th Division, thereby failing to make concerted attack. On 3rd December 1943, the Chinese Regiment Commander Chai Yee Sun died gloriously while leading the last Chinese combat unit when covering the retreat of General Yu Ching Man and the remnants of the 57th division. On 6th December, the Japanese found themselves attacked by seven corps from the Chinese Sixth Front and the Ninth Front and the Japanese high command decided to withdraw to prevent the annihilation of the Japanese 11th Army.<br/><br/>On 7th December, General Yu Ching Man led the remnants of the 57th Division and coordinated with the 11th Division to attack Changde. On 9th Division, the Chinese entered the city through the Eastern gate and recovered Changde City. The Japanese withdrew back to the original frontline in early January 1944. In this battle, less than 300 of the original 8,000 defenders survived and the Japanese lost more than 4,000 soldiers in the sieget with total casualties of the campaign around 10,000. Chinese casualties were more than 100,000 but they held the City of Changde at a terrible price.<br/><br/>Scale<br/>1hex = 800m , unit = bataillon.

Each player starts with a lord, a castle and some troops in one of the villages.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, check to see whether one or more players have won, with shared wins being possible through alliances created by marriage. Winning solo is tough, so players need to negotiate, make deals and form alliances. To do this, players use their three embassy pawns; by spending a pawn, a player can have a three-minute-long private conversation with one or more other players to make whatever deals they wish. You have only three pawns, so plan well for these talks!<br/><br/>Players draw cards each round: character cards that can bring new lords into play and event cards such as good harvests, good weather and taxes. They pay the costs to play cards, with some cards being playable at any time to upset current events with a surprise assassination or underground invasion. Players then receive income, with which they can buy troops and buildings, and move lords and troops among villages, with troops never being able to travel without a lord. If troops from more than one player end up in the same village, they battle until one side is eliminated or forced to flee.<br/><br/>If a player controls all villages in a fief and has at least one castle there, he can purchase the title of the fief and assign it to a lord, with the title being passed to an heir if the lord subsequently dies. Players also try to secure the titles of king and pope, which provide benefits of their own, as well as points.

The objective is to collect the best Fortune Hand from several rounds of drafting. The twist is that players control the number of cards to draft, points they score, and Fortune Hands they make through a common mechanism that leads to many strategic decisions and tactical plays.<br/><br/>Players begin with ten cards and starts by drafting five cards. Players will then play cards or pass. Each card they play will reduce the number of cards to be drafted next, as well as be the additional stakes of the player. The cards played will also form a common pool of cards that players can use to form the best Fortune Hand. Once four cards have been played, players can either play the fifth and final card or draw and discard a card.<br/><br/>The discarded card can be stolen by other players, so players have to be careful with discards and the ever-increasing stakes as the game progresses. Once the fifth card is played, the players will compare Fortune Hands and the winner will score points based on stakes played and a Fortune Modifier. The game ends after every player has a chance to deal, or after a pre-agreed number of rounds.<br/><br/>To excel in F3, you will need the cunning of a boardgame player, the opportunistic instincts of a Hold'em player, the tactical savvy of a Mahjong player, and the risk-taking skills of a Hanafuda player.

Designed for those players, that enjoy strategic planning and quick thinking.<br/><br/>QF is played using the same cards as the core set &ndash; each card has two symbols on it, there are 12 different symbols altogether. Most of the cards are identical to the ones in the core set, while others have different symbol combinations on them. The set also includes a few special text cards (action cards).<br/><br/>The goal of the game is the same as in The Enigma of Leonardo, to collect Secret Keys, by making sequences of identical symbols but this time the game is played on one big field. The field itself is made during game play, the only restriction being its size &ndash; 5x5 cards. The first card is placed in the middle of the playing field, players then take turns at playing cards, increasing the field. In the end, the first card that was played might not even be in the middle anymore, it could be on the edge.<br/><br/>Players can not only play cards on empty spaces, they can play cards on top of each other and can even replace cards from their hands with the ones on the playing field. The only condition is that the cards being replaced must share a common symbol. This playing mechanic allows for more complex combos, by careful planning, one can gradually replace all the cards on the field with symbols that the player needs.<br/><br/>Just like in The Enigma of Leonardo, in QF players receive Secret Keys when they successfully make a row of cards with the same symbol. But now you can get symbols not only for 3 cards in a row, but for four and even five identical symbols. Qunitis fontis actually means &ndash; &ldquo;the fifth symbol&rdquo;, when translated from Latin. Rows can be made horizontally, diagonally and vertically just like in the core game but now you can receive the same key more than once by first making a row of three symbols and then adding cards with the fourth and fifth symbol.<br/><br/>But it sounds much easier than it actually is. The game now uses a special counter-marker called &ldquo;veto&rdquo;. After playing a card, the player may choose to move the marker on any card (even the one he just played) on the playing field. The next player cannot play any cards that share a symbol with the marked card. It&rsquo;s up to the players to decide should they move the marker each turn or keep it in one place blocking a certain symbol combination for the entire game.<br/><br/>Another new addition to QF are the action cards. There aren&rsquo;t much compared to another expansion of the game The Enigma of Leonardo &ndash; Novem &ndash; but they can alter the flow of the game. With these cards you can steal symbols from your opponents and prevent them from gaining new ones.<br/><br/>The player who successfully collects seven Keys is the winner. If the deck is used up and no one has collected seven Keys, the one to collect the most is the winner. In case of a tie a key gradation has been provided.<br/><br/>QF is basically a harder version of The Enigma of Leonardo: the rules are different but the cards used are practically identical. Meaning you can try playing The Enigma of Leonardo using QF or vice versa. It will be a slightly different game, but it&rsquo;s still possible.<br/><br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/>    The Enigma of Leonardo<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.5, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Sergey Machin"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Renaissance"], "name": "The Enigma of Leonardo: Quintis Fontis", "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 5.10714, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.35196, "numcomments": 7}, "107977": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 1, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1275243.jpg", "wishing": 2, "owned": 3, "trading": 0, "id": 107977, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 10, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 2, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1275243_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Percot Rondeau \u00c9ditions", "Pink Monkey Games"], "families": [], "description": "Most of the cards in this card game are letter cards, with which a word is formed; the rest are special action cards.

Each player controls a passenger of each Class and a member of the Crew. Each character has a different starting point, an attempt to recreate the exact location where they were on the ship, thanks to historical research led by the author in cooperation with history experts on the Titanic, such as Claudio Bossi. Thanks to an intuitive movement system, players will move their passengers through the ship, trying to reach the lifeboats on the dock.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the water floods in quickly and the risk of drowning is very high.

It is as close and yet far from Chinese Mahjong as Sh&ocirc;gi (Japanese Chess) can be the same and yet different from original Chess. Mahjong was brought to Japan in 1904, but the Riichi form that is used in modern times probably originated from the 1920s. Today, the worldwide famous Mahjong Association officially recognized the complete rules of Riichi Mahjong for Tournaments.<br/><br/>The main differences are :<br/>1) The 1-Yaku minimum: In order to win a hand, it can only be validated when your hand has at least one of the Yaku (specific hand combinations) in it.<br/>2) Dora: A specific bonus tiles are indicated by the flipped tile from the dead wall and providing other possible Han bonus.<br/>3) Riichi: When a player is Tenpai (one tile away from having a Mahjong hand, valid or not), he can bet a 1000 points chip to add one Yaku to his hand (thus validating a possible invalid hand).  Winning with a Riichi hand allows access to the hidden ura-dora, which is an added dora indicator located underneath the revealed dora tile.<br/>4) Abortive draws: Specific conditions, which ends a hand without winning prior to the drawing of all tiles, aside from the dead wall.<br/>5) Scoring system: Much more complex than in Chinese Mahjong, it is based on hand combinations (Yaku) providing multipliers (Han) that combine with some other circumstantial points like the type of tiles in the hand (Fu) for any 4 han or less.  The combination of Han and Fu correspond to a chart (and even an equation) to finally produce the hand's scoring points (Ten).<br/><br/>Some other minor elements in the Riichi Mahjong differ from the original Mahjong but are not important enough to be fully mentioned, like the Red 5 tiles (a non-official variant sometimes used which gives bonus like the Dora) or the validation of some Yaku (when the hand must be kept hidden or not, depending on the Japanese region where the game is played).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 4, "averageweight": 2.6, "bayesaverage": 5.79137, "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "name": "Japanese Mahjong", "playingtime": 120, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "2999"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "159"}], "average": 8.35299, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.76967, "numcomments": 21}, "108019": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "usersrated": 2, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1130207.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 3, "trading": 0, "id": 108019, "yearpublished": 1985, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1130207_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Waddington's Games, Inc."], "families": ["Animals: Horses"], "description": "Juvenile horse-riding themed dice-rolling game in two phases.<br/><br/>In part one, &quot;Schooling Track&quot;, players throw a d6 to move around and collect (or lose) horseshoes.<br/><br/>In part two, &quot;Cross Country Track&quot;, players use a die numbered 1,2,3 to move and attempt jumps.

In each round the players simultaneously choose and reveal one of their actions that will allow them to allocate one of their Minions to an area on their Lair, obtain money, obtain a blueprint for an invention, or build one of their inventions if they have enough money to do so. The minions that you allocate to your Lair can earn you additional income depending on the actions that your neighbors choose. The first player to build 20 or more points worth of Inventions AND have more points than any other player wins.<br/><br/>There is a twist to the game, though &ndash; actually, two twists! At the beginning of the game, you randomly draw two Twist cards, which change the environment so that the game plays differently each time.

Additionally you&rsquo;ll need one pawn to represent the Librarian.<br/><br/>Win: The game is over when the Time Track eurocube reaches [40] and you complete your turn.

Sell a book, if completed, in the Tower the Librarian is currently standing on. Turn over the next 2 Artisan cards from the draw deck. Place the second card to the right of the first and look at the florin value on the second card as indicated by the Florin icon at on the first card. This is the amount the Librarian is willing to pay for this book. You may pay extra 1 day of time to turn over another card replacing the current Florin amount. You may continue to do this, paying 1 day of time per card turned over, until you are satisfied with the price.     <br/>Mark this amount on your Florin Track and return all Artisan eurocubes from the completed book to your pool. Then mark the production of a book on your Book track, moving the red eurocube forward one space, and if the book is one of those needed for a Prestige Collection, mark that book on the Prestige Collection card as well with a red eurocube. Note: you may pay extra days of time only if they remain on the Time Track. Lastly, place all drawn cards used to calculate the Florin value on the discard pile.<br/>c. Discard one Artisan card from your hand to the discard pile and place that number of black eurocubes on the Artisans indicated by the card, on any one Tower. Then discard one more card from your hand to pay for those Artisans. You may do this action twice if you wish. You do not receive any surplus Artisans from the discarded card. Nor do you receive any surplus Artisans if your tower already has the number required for that Artisan type.

From its military origin comes the peculiar quadrilateral structure divided by the main streets. Later, the city developed to become an important political and cultural center and a prosperous trading city, especially for precious goods, thanks to its convenient and efficient river port. Important monuments such as the Gladiator Arena, the horse-racing Stadium, and the famous theater were built, as well as craftsmen's workshops, patrician villas which completed the architectural network of the city.<br/><br/>In Aquileia, players want to become the most powerful figure in the city by trading and building. Each player, representing a wealthy Aquileian patrician, owns a certain number of henchmen (pawns) which he uses for these main activities: sports playing, culture, trading, and building. Each activity can bring expenses, earnings and sometimes victory points (VPs).<br/><br/>Each round begins with a placement phase in which players take turns placing their henchmen on action spaces and their tiebreaker disc on the tiebreaker track. Placing the tiebreaker is mandatory; placing henchmen is not (but you probably want to place them). Once everyone has passed or placed all of their tokens, players resolve the action spaces in numerical order:<br/><br/><br/>    The Mercatus allows players to buy weapons, arms and slave cards, collect money through a die roll, claim four blue dice for use with the Arena and Stadium, and trade one currency for another. (This is the only way to make change, and some actions require specific currencies; if you must pay bronze and have only silver and gold, then you cannot take that action!)<br/>    At the Arena, players compare fighting strength, with that number determined by the starting strength on the action space claimed, the roll of three dice and the playing of slave and weapon cards. The winner gets three bronze coins and either double his strength in VPs or a slave card. The second and third best players receive lesser rewards.<br/>    The Stadium is similar to the Arena, with the horse cards coming into play and the winner receiving gold or silver coins and his choice of two laurel cards; laurel cards deliver 3-10 VPs or are a multiplier for endgame scoring.<br/>    The Theatrum brings a bid for a dual-colored laurel card, with players needing to ante and raise in particular currencies. <br/>    In the Forum, players build villas and private banks, sometimes scoring points for doing so when they pay the specific costs with the proper coins.<br/>    Finally, the Portus gives players a chance to activate their buildings, thereby earning them VPs or money.<br/><br/><br/>After six rounds, the game ends and players score VPs for their hidden point cards and the product of their villas' values times laurel cards of a matching color. (For example, a total of 8 points of blue villas and three blue villa cards equals 24 points.)

Each Character Card has a normal and a wounded side.<br/><br/>- Equipment Cards:<br/>Equipment Cards represented the different equipment in the game, like a M16, a PSG-1 or a Bulletproof Vest. Characters can be equipped with Equipment Cards, to increase their fight or defense ability. The equipment cards also serve as dice rolls. Each card has a Fate Number printed on it, which is between 0 and 5. In Combat you can play an Equipment Card from your hand to boost your Attack- or Defense-Value and then you always adds the Fate Number from top card of your Equipment Deck to determine the outcome of this action. Equipped Cards are no longer in your Equipment Deck and so their Fate Numbers are no longer in the dice pool. If your characters have good equipment, than the player will have fewer good Fate Numbers in his Deck. So each player has to find the right balance between right equipment and the remaining Fate Numbers in his deck.<br/><br/>- Terrain Cards:<br/>A Terrain Card represents a part of the arena, where the characters compete against each other. Every card is divided in 6 (3x2) squares and has a different setup of covers and obstacles, like Metal Walls and Mud Pits.<br/><br/>- Scenario Cards:<br/>Each Scenario Card represents a game mode, like Deathmatch, Capture the Flag or Domination.

One was to reflect the slower rate of fire for matchlock weapons. That was easy enough.<br/><br/>The second was to bring in the flair and 'swashbuckling' aspects of the period into the rules. It is often forgotten that schools of martial arts were as thorough and widespread in Europe as they were in Japan in the 1500's through the 1600's. There were all kinds of flashy moves and clever tricks.<br/><br/>So the rules weave in this kind of option to do more than simply move-attack-resolve-repeat. More than just strict combat options, the Swashbuckling rules allow you to be more interactive with your terrain. It opens up more of the game to narrative, or story-telling wargaming.

It includes three battles: Foz do Arouce, Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro and El Bodon 1811 which are thus be the 32nd, 33rd and 34th battles of the series.<br/><br/>The game is also the 6th entry in the Vae Victis Wargame Collection. The main battle, Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro, has an A2 map and the two smaller ones have A3 maps. The game include 216 counters and markers.<br/><br/>Foz do Arouce, 15th March 1811<br/>The fight took place just after Redhina and Casal Novo but before Sabugal and Fuentes de Onoro, as Wellington followed Massena out of the lines of Torres Vedras. It included two popular British divisions, the 3rd and the Light. The French under Ney held a ridge with a river behind it that was crossed by a single bridge. The French ridge on their left was much higher than the one on the right. In the centre there was a gap of about 200 yards, occupied by the village of Foz d'Arouce. Some companies of the 95th rifles penetrated down a hollow road there, almost unopposed, quite close to the bridge. The rest of the Light division held Marchand in a frontal fight on the French right. Half of Mermet&rsquo;s division on the French left faced the 3rd Division. The 39th lost its eagle in the river as they tried to cross a deep ford below the bridge, and many men were drowned.<br/><br/>Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro, 3rd to 5th May 1811<br/>On the 3rd of May, Mass&eacute;na launched a frontal assault against the British-Portuguese pickets holding the barricaded village, while subjecting the British-Portuguese on the heights east of the village to a heavy artillery bombardment. The village was the centre of the fighting for the whole day, with French soldiers of Ferey's and Marchand's divisions clashing with the British redcoats of the 1st and 3rd Divisions. May 4 saw little combat. Both sides recovered from the ferocity of the previous day of fighting and reconsidered their options and battle plans. A French reconnaissance revealed that Wellington's right flank was weakly held by a unit of partisans near the hamlet of Pozo Bello. Action began again at dawn on the 5th of May. Wellington had left the 7th Division exposed on his right flank. Mass&eacute;na launched a heavy attack on the weak British-Portuguese flank, led by Montbrun's dragoons and supported by the infantry divisions of Marchand, Mermet and Solignac. Right away, two 7th Division battalions were roughed up by French light cavalry. This compelled Wellington to send reinforcements to save the 7th Division from annihilation. This was only achieved by the efforts of the Light Division and the British and King's German Legion cavalry. In response, Wellington counterattacked with units from the 1st and 3rd Divisions, plus the Portuguese 6th Ca&ccedil;adores. Led by the 88th Connaught Rangers Foot, this effort broke Drouet's attack and the tide began to turn. Low on ammunition, the French had to resort to the bayonet in a futile attempt to drive the British back. Drouet launched a second attack on the town. This time it was led by three battalions of converged grenadiers from IX Corps. With their old-fashioned bearskin hats, the grenadiers were mistaken for the Imperial Guard. Again, the British fell back. Drouet threw in about half of the battalions from both Conroux and Clapar&egrave;de's divisions, seizing almost the entire town. The French artillery tried to bombard the new British line into submission, but they were outgunned by Wellington's cannon. Finally, with their artillery ammunition dangerously low, the French attacks came to an end. Wellington's men entrenched during the evening.<br/><br/>El Bodon 25th September 1811<br/>The fight included a French cavalry force of 2500, against a mixed force of Picton&rsquo;s 3rd Division consisting of 1000 men, 500 cavalry and two Portuguese batteries. The French attacked in 3 columns of cavalry with a 4th column in reserve, &quot;since only parts of the hillside were open ground suitable for cavalry.&quot; The attack fell upon the isolated part of Wallace&rsquo;s Brigade covering the road. As the French columns came up the slope they were attacked by Alten&rsquo;s light cavalry one squadron at a time &quot;with the slope in their favour.&rdquo; The individual squadrons then rallied behind their supports. The British had to hold on, to allow time for the widely separated parts of 3rd Division to retire.<br/><br/>Fuentes de Onoro 1811 includes:<br/><br/>    A 59 x 40 cm map,<br/>    216 double-sided die-cut counters and markers,<br/>    A color rulebook with scenarios and a player aid.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Units : Regiments and brigades<br/>Map scale : 500 m/hex.<br/>Turn : 120 minutes<br/><br/>Complexity : 6 / 9<br/><br/>Bilingual Rules and Charts (English/French).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.6471, "bayesaverage": 5.65589, "designers": ["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bey"], "categories": ["Napoleonic", "Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Fuentes de Onoro 1811", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 240, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "4406"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "597"}], "average": 7.99167, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.35879, "numcomments": 30}, "108433": {"mechanics": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "usersrated": 1, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1099499.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "trading": 0, "id": 108433, "yearpublished": 1973, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1099499_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Reeves Southwest"], "families": ["Rodeo"], "description": "Hoolihan is a game of luck, skill and chance.

But there are wild animals lurking, mountains blocking the way, and a wide variety of unpleasant diseases waiting to invade your body. When you think it cannot possibly get any worse, you feel a taunting raindrop on your cheek&hellip;<br/><br/>In Wilderness, 2 to 8 players race to the nearest civilized village &ndash; but the village is not near, and the way there is not paved. You will have to find water, search for food, avoid wolves, bears and snakes, endure sicknesses and keep your strength up to be able to get there.<br/><br/>Each player's health is tracked with three parameters: thirst, hunger and exhaustion. Every turn you get more thirsty and hungry and exhausted. The thirstier and hungrier you are, the more exhausted you become, and that determines how much energy you will have each turn. If the exhaustion hits the bottom, you die. The energy is used to walk, but also to search for food or rest. To regain your strength (reduce your exhaustion) you also have to sleep. One of the biggest risks is encountering a predator since they attack you with two dice and you defend with only one and increase exhaustion equal to the difference. And they can scent you from a mile away...<br/><br/>The game board is discovered gradually as players progress across it, and there are six turns each day (four day turns, two night turns). Each day has different special rules and each landscape tile has its own challenges. Each landscape tile has 21 hexagonal areas in a big triangle and each area has a terrain type such as mountain, wood, swamp and so on, and the tile may also include a predator lair. Different terrain types have their benefits and challenges. The combination and orientation of different landscape tiles make the way forward uncertain and new every game. To top it off, the players have a limited supply of cards that can be played to help yourself or thwart your opponent in certain situations.<br/><br/>Besides the normal six-tile board, the game can be played in an easy, short version by having only four landscape tiles, or it can be played in a challenging long version by including all eight available landscape tiles.<br/><br/>The hand-made edition of Wilderness sold out at Spiel 2011. FryxGames is releasing a professionally published version in the first half of 2012, and this version will have improved game play and graphics. For example, search for food has replaced hunting.

By 1307, the &ldquo;poor comrades-in-arms&rdquo; were one of the richest organizations in Europe: one that would attract the covetous eyes of the French king.<br/><br/>In The Mystery of the Templars, players become the masters of this secretive organization. They must assign their knights to the critical task of escorting pilgrims, but also to seek out and discover long-lost artifacts of Christian lore. Using their holdings in the Holy Land, they procure valuable trade goods, which must then be transported to the hungry markets of Europe, using the profits to expand the Order&rsquo;s holdings. But along the way brigands and pirates threaten the flow of goods and wealth, and must be challenged by valorous knights to safeguard the precious caravans and trade ships. To be successful, the players must balance the needs of trade, development, and battle.<br/><br/>In time, the powerful enemies of the Templars will strike, beginning the Persecution which will eventually cause the destruction of the Order. In those last desperate days, the players must flee from their Commanderies with all the wealth and relics they can carry, seeking refuge in the farthest corners of the world.

So, when two hot-shot fly-boys needed to settle their differences, they grabbed a buddy and had them duke it out mano-a-mano on the wings of aeroplanes. Those crowds would sure hoot and holler as we flew nearly 50 mph to heights of almost 30 feet.  You kids wouldn't remember those days.  So, I made this paper and card game-set box to show you nancies how we used to do it.  Back when flying and racing was pure.<br/><br/>Did I say racing?  Why I can't really remember why we were racin' too.  But, hell, that's exactly how I remember it, so that's how you're gonna play it.  The old-fashioned way.

The days when the only way to fight was to have a buddy stand on your wing and engage in fisticuffs (machine-guns were too heavy, or course).  Through the use of dual-purpose action cards, players have to navigate obstacles on the modular race-track while their fighters spar on the wings of their planes.  Will you win over the crowd and cross the finish line or go down in a ball of flames?<br/><br/>Play is fast and actions are revealed simultaneously.  While the game uses a rock-paper-scissors mechanic for fighting (punch, kick, grapple), there is always the option for the losing player to &quot;trade blows,&quot; essentially turning the tables.  But, since cards are not always drawn each turn, losing a battle may sometimes be more beneficial than winning.  With obstacles that bring players one step closer to explosion, hand management, and plane positioning complicating each situation, &quot;Punchin' Planes&quot; is a short game for 2 players with a surprising strategic depth.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["T.

When the spinner lands on this spot, the Yellow Car moves five spaces, and the Blue Car moves three.<br/><br/>Cars may change lanes if they have an unoccupied spot to move to. (A car that is boxed in my even move backwards to get free.) If two cars &quot;collide&quot; by occupying the same space, then the car that initiated the collusion is penalized two laps, and the car that got hit, one lap.<br/><br/>The number of laps is determined by player agreement at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>Game includes a board, four plastic cards, and an insert with a spinner and a series of peg holes to track the laps.

There is a big bag, which contains the playing pieces in six colours. If you play a two player game, each player will have three colours.

These games share some of the same components, but each game has a unique board, and two of the games have card decks just for them. It appears that none of these games were ever produced separately. All games may be played solo, or with a number of other players based on the game.<br/><br/>Grand Pree Road Race<br/><br/>Players use cars 1 through 12 and move the their cars around a game board track as instructed by a spinner and by use of a deck of cards that comes with the game. Special rules govern how many cars may occupy a space, and which car(s) get to move in the event of too may cars heading toward the same space. First player to pass the finish line wins.<br/><br/>Demolition Derby<br/><br/>Up to 30 cars may be included, although 10 players seems to me the suggested maximum. (This allows each player to control three cars.) Game is played on the Demolition Derby board which features some Safe spots where cars may not be hit.<br/><br/>Cars move by means of a spinner (numbered 1 to 30) to determine which car is moved and a special deck of cards which determines distance and direction of movement. (Some cards allow for a choice about direction.) Since there is a set turn order, a player may end up moving an opponent's car.<br/><br/>When a car passes onto or over another car, the stationary car takes a Hit. Cars that take three Hits are eliminated from the game and removed from play. A wipe-off scoreboard with a crayon and a felt eraser are included to keep track of Hits. Play continues until only one car remains.<br/><br/>Drag Race Championships<br/><br/>Again all 30 cars are used. The game uses the Drag Race board. Before play begins, the 1-30 spinner is used to determine which cars are in which Heats. Play progresses by using the 1-12 spinner which shows which color car is moved, along with the roll of a single die to determine distance. One car advances from each of the 6 Heats. A final round is played to determine the Champion.<br/><br/>The 500 Mile Race<br/><br/>This game is played on the box insert which shows an oval track with various Sequence Tables printed in the center. Game may be played with up to 30 players, each controlling an individual car. The game starts with the Sequence Marker on Sequence Table &quot;A&quot;. Two dice are rolled and the numbers are added together. (The Sequence Table contains results from 2 to 12.) The result of the Sequence Table tells which cars may be moved... these cars are all advanced 3 spaces on the track. In the next turn the Sequence Marker is advanced and Sequence Table &quot;B&quot; is used. The Sequence Marker moves each turn, and goes back to Table A again if the game last long enough. Some Sequence Table results show hazards like Crash, Pit Stop, etc. The 1-30 spinner is used to determine which car is affected.<br/><br/>Four cars abreast stop cars behind them from advancing. However, there are a couple of spots on the board where cars are considered to crash if there are ever four cars on them. (This cuts down on the amount of log jams in a really crowded game.) Play continues until a car crosses the finish line. In the event of a tie, play continues until one car advances ahead of another.<br/><br/>The (many) game elements for this title include: one double-sided rules sheet, 30 die-cut pressboard cars, a sequence marker, a double-sided game board (with the Grand Pree race board on one side, and the Demolition Derby and Drag Race boards on the other), a wipe-off scoreboard (for Demolition Derby), a crayon &amp; felt eraser, a 1-30 spinner, a 1-12 spinner, two 6-sided dice, a deck of 20 cards with an image of a tire on the back (for Grand Pree Road Race), &amp; a deck of 20 cards with checkered flags on the back (for Demolition Derby).<br/><br/>No publication date is included with this title.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["Racing"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Race-O-Rama Game Chest", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "108800": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1097360.png", "wishing": 0, "owned": 4, "trading": 0, "id": 108800, "yearpublished": 1950, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1097360_t.png", "publishers": ["Hugo Gr\u00e4fe Verlag", "Spika"], "families": [], "description": "Objective: Be the first to finish<br/><br/>'Roll and Move' game with some modifications.<br/>Of course, there are some fields to accelerate or decelerate your car (your bride is waiting for you, you have to make a phone call...), but using your three dice ==&gt; only '1' and '5' are giving you the speed you need.

The goal of the game is to play all of your number and joker cards by building a grid &ndash; four rows, each from one to twenty-one.<br/><br/>Each turn, you may play up to four cards from your hand. If you cannot play a card, or don't want to, you draw one card from the draw pile. The cards must be played according to the following rules:<br/><br/>    You must place a number card next to a card that is one higher or lower of the same colour and that is already on the table. So, the red twelve must be placed next to the red eleven, and the red thirteen must be placed next to the red twelve (or in front of the red fourteen). So, the red thirteen cannot be played if neither the twelve nor the fourteen has been played unless you use a connection card.<br/>    Alternatively, you can use a connection card to place a card above or below a card with the same number and a different colour. For example, if the green row is above the yellow row, and the green nine has already been played, you may use a connection card to play the yellow nine in the yellow row. The connection cards are not part of your hand, so they don't count toward the maximum of four cards that you may play during a round.<br/>    A joker may be placed instead of any other number cards. If a player has a number card whose spot is occupied by a joker, he may exchange that card for the joker.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>If a player completes a segment from one to eleven or from eleven to twenty-one, he receives a bonus card.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has played the last card from his hand. Then, points are counted:<br/><br/>    Each bonus card is worth 11 points.<br/>    Each number card that a player still holds is worth as many minus points as its value.<br/>    Each joker that a player still holds is worth 11 minus points.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/>    Elfer raus!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Wolfgang Kramer"], "categories": ["Card Game"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Elfer raus!

Drafting, teamwork, accidents, yellow flags, pit strategy, working to lead laps, and sprints to the finish are all included and bring the feel of racing to the game. Players control not one car, but a team of 3&ndash;6 cars. Thus, each race is not only a run for the checkered flag but an effort to maximize the score for every car on your team. Winning is important, but if only one car crosses the finish line, your team might end up outside the winner's circle looking in.<br/><br/>The game includes four different types of movement, often with many cars moving with the play of a single card, and each type has its place and time:<br/><br/><br/>    Solo movement allows you to break away from the pack.<br/>    Draft and pursuit movement are best used for keeping your team of cars together.<br/>    Lead movement can create a pack of cars that moves toward the front.<br/><br/><br/>Turns are fast, each play is important, and the track situation is fluid. The wrong movement in the wrong situation can be disastrous, with you possibly being left out of the draft and all alone. Experienced players will be able to identify the best type of movement for the current situation.<br/><br/>Cars suffer wear over the course of a race and need to take pit stops. Tire wear, suspension difficulties, fuel issues, and major engine and transmission problems are all modeled in the game. If you feel lucky, you might try to hold it together just a little bit longer in hopes that a yellow flag will come out and cause a mass rush into the pits. Waiting on a yellow that never comes can be maddening as the rest of the pack moves by your worn-out car. What's more, an events deck can make your strategy pay off or punish you for your failure to take precautions. Accidents, yellow flags, worsening track situations, and deteriorating cars are all part of the game. Could all of your perfect strategy be derailed by those incoming rain clouds?<br/><br/>Included in the game are four different race tracks: a tri-oval super speedway for wide-open free-wheeling racing and a short track for a tight wheel-to-wheel bumper car duel. Each track uses the same deck of racing cards but the cards that work best on one may be useless in the other.  The game also includes a second board with a road course and and 3 turned  (triangle) raceway.<br/><br/>Most racing games call for a large number of players to play the game at its best.

Each character in the posse can be customized to fulfill a different role and purchase weapons and equipment from the many options available. Combat takes place in the futuristic landscape of the year 2285, where a supervolcano erupted and changed the course of mankind forever.<br/><br/>In the general the game is built around D12s and is meant to be light, thematic, and fast playing. Players build a Posse containing a Leader, 2-4 Members, and up to 1 Dinosaur, all of which benefit from some unique mechanics. Each Member has an Allegiance such as Duster or Neotechnoist which helps differentiate them (both thematically and statistically). Otherwise there are fairly standard statistics (Speed, Defense, Hitpoints, etc.) which can be customized by spending Improvement Points to really help define a role for each character. Furthermore Active and Passive Traits are selected to let characters do cool things like Crippling Shot, Speed Reload, Go For the Eyes, etc. Weapons and equipment are then purchased from a list of over 75 items ranging from laser Six-Shooters to plasma Shotguns.<br/><br/>A standard game takes place on a tabletop covered in terrain and uses 28mm miniatures and plastic dinosaur toys. Activation of entities is done on a model-by-model basis instead of the entire Posse at once, so the battles are very fluid with plenty of time to react to the enemy. This is especially true as Initiative is rolled at the start of each Activation &quot;set&quot; instead of staying the same for the whole turn.<br/><br/>Posses battle each other in one-off standalone games or in a linked campaign where further Improvement Points and Neodollars can be used to build and grow the group. Likewise injuries can accrue on characters that were taken out of action during an encounter. Deployment, objectives, and features can be used to add depth and variety to each battle beyond &quot;kill everything&quot;.<br/><br/>The full rules are free to download and can be used with any range of miniatures.

Or will you become infected by the Undead and turn on your allies? The possibilities are endless in a game that utilizes randomization and custom structure mechanics that immerse players in a completely fresh scenario with every new round of play.<br/><br/>Based on the ENDICOTT EPIDEMIC multi-media series created by filmmaker and author Douglas Harvey, Endicott Epidemic: The Board Game is the first full board game that accompanies the Endicott Epidemic: Infectious Contagion card game.  While Infectious Contagion was the condensed, &quot;lite&quot; version of the main game, EE:TBG is an epic battle for survival that offers all of the insane mechanics and suspenseful buildup to destruction that the card game couldn't bring to the table (literally).<br/><br/>Utilizing game boards acting as maps based on primary areas of the Endicott Epidemic story (with fully functional expansion &quot;connections&quot; to mix and match your favorite ares as the game expands), players will drop their chosen characters (each with their own unique abilities that can be used strategically) into the heart of the epidemic and begin battling the Undead using classic roll-and-move mechanics as well as a series of unique &quot;Intrique&quot; cubes that modify gameplay with every roll.  A deck of Inquest cards act as side-missions that can be ignored or completed to gain resources used to fight and survive, or to gain special tokens that can be used in many different combinations to unlock new areas of play as the game progresses.<br/><br/>Combat is as simple as choosing your weapon (or brawling unarmed, if you so choose) and rolling the Combat Cubes.  Each face of each cube means a different value, giving you numerous combinations of attack to dish out against your chosen enemy.  But while rolling the cubes is the simple part, bear in mind that your enemies can (and most of the time *will*) fight back or dodge your attack entirely.  Strategize your plan of action before engaging the enemy to give you the best course through the hordes of Undead.  Or, if you think you have the stealth abilities to do so, roll the dice to try to evade the groups of enemies and slip through unnoticed and live to fight another turn.<br/><br/>But beware - hidden with the game's deck of cards lay numerous deadly obstacles ranging from stronger than average 'Boss' Zombies, Black Ops agents, and even a handful of mutant Hazard Zombies, which spread MBI's toxic plume everywhere they go.  Once these villains begin to appear, the spreading plume is something the Survivors must be extremely wary of.  Plume markers begin to build in each area and once they reach their critical mass, deadly chain reactions are caused that could potentially wipe out every living thing on the board.  The biggest and most brutal enemy within the deck, however, is the Countdown - eight cards that constantly remind players of the impending nuclear purge.  Once the eighth and final card is drawn, the game is over - regardless of whether or not the survivors have completed their mission to find the Hermit, his critical intel, and his escape route.<br/><br/>With all of the chaos going on as each Survivor makes their way through the town to complete their mission, the gameplay could get a little too intense for some people's liking.  Endicott Epidemic: The Board Game utilizes a completely customizable experience so that players can create the best scenario that is tailored to how they want to enjoy their game.  Removing certain aspects of the game like Hazard Zombies or Plume counters can greatly reduce the amount of suspenseful buildup that could turn players off from a game that could potentially be nearly impossible to win.  Inventory management and play deck building are also ways a group of players can ease the difficulty and ensure that the game, if played with all the right moves and strategic plans, can indeed be won without laying at the mercy of the Countdown or the roll of a die.<br/><br/>The board game, at its core, is designed for 2-8 players.  However, like Infectious Contagion, the board game also allows a single player to enjoy the game experience as the lone survivor of Endicott&rsquo;s shift from living to undead.  Other game modes include a point-based Survivor mode that removes the Countdown and many other aspects of the game to allow players (or factions/teams of players) to battle waves of Undead, tallying up points at the end of each round and crowning a winner after a set amount of battles.  Or, players (or teams) can simply battle each other without the inclusion of Zombies (but with a Countdown) in a vastly customizable VS mode.<br/><br/>A ticking time-bomb's clock, swarms of Undead that will chain themselves together to create deadly hordes, an ever-spreading toxic plume beneath your feet, stealthy Black Ops agents that mark you for execution when you fall within their sights, a limited number of resources that must be used in conjunction with an even more limited inventory system, a constant surge of adrenaline with every roll of the Intrigue cubes, making allies with your fellow Survivors only to find your group surrounded by Zombies with only two bullets and a grenade...all of this and more is what builds your game up from a simple beginning to an all-out epic battle for survival.

Only by working together can the players prevent the enemy from exploiting these weaknesses, and only by working together can they bring the enemy to their knees!<br/><br/>In addition to mixing cooperation with competition, the core of the gameplay ensures that the players practically have no downtime at all. You are either attacking or defending all the time, eliminating the need to wait for your turn.<br/><br/>Iron Sky: The Board Game takes a different approach to the universe of Iron Sky.

The Curling Card Game is a fun, fast paced card game suitable for curling fans of all ages.  Grab your teammates and take on your fiercest rivals to decide once and for all who really rules the ice.  Or go head-to-head against a fellow curler to determine who will be King of the Rings.<br/><br/>Playable by two, four, six or even eight players, Hurry Hard! recreates all the action on the ice in a fun, easy to learn card game.  Players take turns throwing guards, draws, or takeouts.  Your teammates can then improve the impact of your throw, including through the play of the powerful Hurry Hard! sweeping card to help get your rock a little closer to the button. Watch out though!  Your opponents can also affect your throw.  The timely play of a Miss the Broom card can ruin an end, unless you have a Plan B card in reserve.  After the player with The Hammer throws the last rock, the score for the end is calculated the same as in real curling, based on whose rocks are closest to the button.  Then a new end begins.<br/><br/>For non-curlers, the rules explain not just how to play the card game, but also the basic terminology to help you understand the game of curling itself.<br/><br/>For curlers, the game has been well balanced to reward real curling strategy.  Deciding when to throw a guard or when to come into the rings can make the difference between scoring a big end or giving up a steal.  Just as with real curling, though, no matter how good your strategy, you still need to make your throws.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Brent Barrie"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Sports"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Hurry Hard!

In 1625, the Thirty Years' War is underway, and military leaders like Albrecht von Wallenstein and Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim are roaming the country, fighting for land, and trying to establish the best of everything for themselves. The game lasts two &quot;years,&quot; with players taking actions in the spring, summer, and fall, then possibly suffering from grain shortage and revolts in the winter before scoring points for the year. After two years, the player with the most points &ndash; with points being scored for land and buildings under one's control &ndash; wins.<br/><br/>In each of the &quot;action&quot; seasons, ten action cards are shuffled, then laid out, with five face-up and the rest face-down. The five bonus tiles (which provide extra money, grain, or armies) are also laid out. Each player then secretly assigns one of his county cards (or a blank card) to each of the ten actions on his individual player board, in addition to bidding for player order and choice of bonus tile.<br/><br/>After revealing that round's event card and determining player order, players carry out actions in the order determined earlier, revealing which county is taking the current action, then revealing the next face-down action, thus giving players some information about when actions will occur, but not all. Taxing a county or taking grain from it can increase the chance of a revolt during winter, but without money you can't deploy troops or build palaces or churches and without grain you increase the chance of revolt.<br/><br/>Combat and revolts are handled via a dice tower in which players drop army units and peasants (colored wooden cubes) into the top of the tower and see which ones emerge in the bottom tray (representing the fighting forces for that combat) and which get stuck in the tower's baffles to possibly emerge in the future.<br/><br/>Wallenstein includes two expansions: &quot;Emperor's Court,&quot; in which a player's army tokens that fall from the dice tower at the start of the game become courtiers who compete for favors (special actions) from the emperor; a player can convert armies to courtiers during the game, and whoever has the most courtiers in the court's entrance hall each turn gets first shot at the favors available. &quot;Landsknechte,&quot; which can be used with &quot;Emperor's Court&quot; or on its own, consists of a set of four cards for each player stacked in a particular order. If after determining turn order, a player controls counties in four different regions, he removes the top card from the stack, then takes one of the bonuses (such as money or armies in the tray) shown on the newly revealed card. This stack resets after winter ends.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 3.2048, "bayesaverage": 6.6484, "designers": ["Dirk Henn"], "categories": ["Economic", "Renaissance", "Territory Building"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Wallenstein (second edition)", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 120, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "631"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "305"}], "average": 7.71388, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.29141, "numcomments": 263}, "109139": {"mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Set Collection", "Tile Placement"], "usersrated": 390, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1102392.jpg", "wishing": 96, "owned": 1791, "trading": 40, "id": 109139, "yearpublished": 2011, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 23, "wanting": 37, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1102392_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Queen Games"], "families": ["Alhambra", "BoardGameGeek Promo Offerings", "Cities: Granada", "Country: Spain"], "description": "Alhambra: The Magical Buildings, a promotional item from Queen Games for Spiel 2011, consists of six new tiles &ndash; one in each of the six colors of buildings &ndash; that are placed in the bag with the other tiles at the start of the game.<br/><br/>When drawn, they are placed for sale as with any other building.

Players fight to win battles in a futuristic civil war with a variety of ship types. From the agile and speedy Fighters, to lethal Gunships and intimidating Capital Ships, every battle is a well-balanced slugfest that comes right down to the wire. Our new Trinity Mechanic uses boards, cards and dice together in an extremely innovative and easy-to-learn system that lets new players jump right in.<br/><br/>What makes the Gunship series unique are the numerous combinations of ships that the players &quot;build&quot; at the start of each battle. By choosing from an ever-growing selection (through expansions) of available Weapons and Upgrades, players are able to create a custom Gunship that is suited to their particular style of play or battle situation. Some guys are &quot;defensive&quot; minded; they'll choose Heavy Armor, +1 Shield Generators and 4 Blaster Cannons to fend off the enemy Gunship. But another player might prefer to build a &quot;Carrier Killer&quot; complete with wings full of Bombs and an Autoblaster Cannon to shred his way through the enemy Fighter Squadron. While most of the Upgrade cards are geared toward the Gunships (the true star of the show) you can also do some great things to your Fighters and Capital Ships. New kinds of ships will come with every expansion to further add to the possibilities. No two battles are ever the same!<br/><br/>In Gunship: First Strike!, the civil war has just started. Your orders are simple: Command a task force of one Assault Carrier and its Gunship and Fighters on a mission to destroy the enemy's Carrier. Guess what? He has the very same orders! Dogfights will ensue, Torpedoes will strike home and Thruster Bombs are going to pound the Capital Ships mercilessly. If your Gunship takes too much damage for comfort, or if the battle situation changes and you want a different weapon load, land inside your Carrier for a quick &quot;pit stop&quot;. Make sure that you defend it with all your might because once your Carrier is gone, the only option left to you is to flee the battlespace and hope to take revenge another day.<br/><br/>As the Gunship universe grows, players will be able to fight bigger and bigger battles. Soon the objectives will include breaking through the enemy picket line to drop troops on the planet below. The Gunships will be called upon to not only assault other ships, but also to go dirtside and give air support to the land battle raging below  A free Campaign System is planned where players can keep track of a fleet of ships and territories. Lose your Carrier in today's battle and you might lose a critical Outpost next week. Don't let the enemy find the Shipyard where your damaged Destroyers limped home last time &ndash; if he does, they're toast!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.4167, "bayesaverage": 5.58976, "designers": ["Steve A.

These signals get the workers what they need, where they need it, when they need it to create a just-in-time (JIT) production system.<br/><br/>The setting for the game Kanban: Automotive Revolution is an assembly line. The players are ambitious managers who are trying to impress the board of directors in order to achieve as high a position as possible in the company and secure their careers. With promotions come advantages at the factory, such as more space to store precious materials and greater prestige to accelerate your ascent. Through solid management, you must strive to shine next to your peers. You need to manage suppliers and supplies, improve automobile parts, innovate &mdash; anything to stay on the cutting edge, or getting your hands greasy on the assembly line in order to boost production. You must exercise wisdom in choosing which projects you should start, selecting only those that will give you the upper hand and shunning those that will bog you down or cause the unthinkable &mdash; failure &mdash; which would diminish you in the eyes of the board.<br/><br/>Over the course of the game, you persuade the board and the factory tender to help you develop and improve automobile parts. You make shrewd use of the outside suppliers and the limited factory supplies in order to appropriate needed part when the suppliers come up short. Because the factory must run at optimum efficiency, production doesn't wait for you or for mistakes.<br/><br/>Like the process itself, Kanban: Automotive Revolution proves to be both innovative and rewarding. Game mechanisms tightly tied to the automobile manufacturing theme include:<br/><br/><br/>    The factory manager is a game-driven non-player character with two modes of play (&quot;nice&quot; or &quot;mean&quot;) to offer a friendly or more competitive gameplay environment.<br/>    Two independent player-influenced game timers &mdash; the factory production cycle and work week clock &mdash; provide timing tension to the game, trigger intermediate scoring phases, and factor into the game end conditions.<br/>    A simulation of the factory assembly line with spatial point-to-point movement adds an element to the game that requires optimal timing.<br/>    A design and innovation department, leveraged to manipulate the value of the various car models and component upgrades produced within the factory, drives the economy of the game.<br/>    Departmental training and certification tracks provide players a means to operate more efficiently.<br/><br/><br/>If you want a seat on the board someday, you need to show that you can keep a complex machine running smoothly, efficiently, with everything happening just at the right time. Kanban: Automotive Revolution is a pure Eurogame focused on economics and resource management that puts you in the driver's seat of an entire production facility, racing for the highest level of promotion.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 4.2872, "bayesaverage": 7.19368, "designers": ["Vital Lacerda"], "categories": ["Economic", "Industry / Manufacturing"], "name": "Kanban", "playingtime": 120, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "190"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "96"}], "average": 7.79374, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.49865, "numcomments": 616}, "109277": {"mechanics": ["Trick-taking"], "usersrated": 2, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic47644.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 5, "trading": 0, "id": 109277, "yearpublished": 1800, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic47644_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Public Domain)"], "families": ["Traditional Card Games"], "description": "The Bisca is a Portuguese variant of Briscola.

The result is that Nations in Arms is an entirely new, and very playable, Napoleonic epic from designer Fran\u00e7ois-Stanislas Thomas.<br/><br/>Players control every major and minor power of the Napoleonic period: from the largest participants to the smallest.

You will have the power of great leaders at your fingertips, and the might of the corps they commanded: line infantry, guards, militia, supply trains, light and reserve cavalry, fleets and more.<br/><br/>Each game year is broken into four interactive, seasonal turns.

After all ships moved, guns are fired from the sides of the miniature to targets in range.<br/><br/>The Wings of Glory game system has been modified and expanded to accurately represent battles at sea between the large sailing ships of the past centuries.

Each player moves in turn commencing with a Plane.<br/>The Moves;<br/>The discs move according to the number obtained by spinning the arrow. The exact number of places must be moved each time and only one disc for each move. Planes must be moved forward (never backward).<br/>The red-circle shells move horizontal (sic) left or right only. The black-circle shell may move horizontal (left or right) or vertically (backwards or forwards) but not outside the green half of the board.<br/>Shells can move only if the number of spaces to be moved brings the shell to a circle of the same colour as a plane in play.<br/>Rules;<br/>The planes' player moves any plane he chooses. He may try to reach his objective with one at a time or more if he so desires, but he must not forego a move if it is possible to move a plane the required space.<br/>Shells may pass over planes but not over another shell.<br/>Planes may pass over another plane or shell.<br/>Losses;<br/>A plane is hit (and thus out of the game) if it comes to a circle occupied by a shell or if a shell hits the plane. That is, if a shell is able to move to a circle occupied by a plane. A hit is also registered if a plane comes to one of the red circles in the yellow half of the board, provided the red line is connected with a circle of the same colour as the plane and this circle has a shell on it or a shell hits it before the plane moves on.<br/>Now place the discs on the circles as marked taking care to put the black-circle shell on its appropriate circle.<br/>If the arrow should stop dead on a dividing line, spin it again.<br/><br/>These rules make a little more sense when you look at the images. Note that it is never properly explained who wins. Does the planes' player win if he gets just one plane to the objective? Or more?

If nobody has conquered the world by the end of the 4th turn to win immediately, the player whose empire got the largest at any given point wins.<br/><br/>Each card can be played in one of 3 ways: Generals allow you to place a pawn in that card's territory to be used for rerolls in combats in or adjacent to the territory.  Playing cards as agents gives you one time effects that reflect that historical figure's abilities (Stalin assassinates, Victoria adds an extra die on a naval attack).  Playing cards as rulers gives you their ability for the duration of your turn and sets a goal that reaching it will net you a power bonus at the end of your turn.<br/><br/>At the start of your turn, you're issued a number of tokens.  This number escalates by one during each player turn to ramp up the epic nature of the game.  You also get the bonus when somebody plays a ruler (including you) in one of your territories, and you'll get it at the end of your turn if you reach your ruler's goals. Tokens convert into armies controlling territories in successful attacks and are spent to pay for failed attacks and sea attacks as a Supply Cost.  Each time you pay the Supply Cost, it escalates.<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay Details<br/><br/>On your turn, you campaign by throwing one die for each territory you control adjacent to a target territory. The defender throws one die for their defending army plus another for each adjacent territory they control. The highest die wins. Losses and Naval attacks have an escalating Supply Cost. When you are unwilling or unable to pay the Supply cost, your turn ends. Make it count, though, because you only get four turns.<br/><br/>Strategic depth is layered onto this simple system by the deck of conqueror cards. Each historical figure has special powers based on their history, such as Erik the Red making unsupplied naval attacks, or Stalin using assassination to eliminate enemies. The cards may be played as your empire's ruler (which makes their power last your whole turn), a local agent (which gives you the power just once), or a general (which ignores their power but gives you combat rerolls). Ruler cards also have a strategic goal, such as Elizabeth's &ldquo;No one else controls a continent&rdquo; or Caesar's &ldquo;Win 5 attacks.&rdquo; Fulfilling these goals gets you a power bonus at the end of your turn.<br/><br/>In the grand tradition of global conquest games, World Conquerors is epic in scope, but it addresses the genre's traditional shortcomings.<br/><br/><br/>     Short Play Time - just four turns per player each game. It plays in about an hour. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     No Player Elimination - each turn you get a new ruler, regardless of the last one's fate.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Quick combat resolution - one army per territory makes battles quick and easy, focusing strategy on card play instead of mass dicefests. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Reduced Kingmaking and Spoiling - ruler goals drive the action leaving little room for spite. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     No Hopeless Positions - supply is based on both time and territory, so it's possible to rebuild a shattered empire from no territories at all. Everybody is in it until their last turn, unless somebody conquers the whole world and wins instantly.<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 2.0, "bayesaverage": 5.55738, "designers": ["Jeff Siadek"], "categories": ["Civilization", "Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "World Conquerors", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "7299"}], "average": 5.99434, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.60011, "numcomments": 68}, "109644": {"mechanics": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1109433.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 109644, "yearpublished": 1989, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1109433_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Identity Toys Inc."], "families": ["Animals: Alligators / Crocodiles"], "description": "A roll-and-move game about crossing an African river while avoiding hungry crocodiles.

So they slide like Queens in Chess, i.e. any number of empty spaces up, down, left, right or diagonally. They may jump over another piece in any direction.

Each player will draft cards into a deck, use those cards to send Trade Caravans across Asia, and build opportunities in trade, military and the court. Players must work together to trade goods while competing to build cards and gain victory points.<br/><br/>Win: Players gain Victory Points (VP) by sending trade caravans across the Silk Road Trade Map and buying/building cards on their side of the Map. The game ends when one player builds 10 cards. At that point the player with the most victory points is the winner.<br/><br/>Needed to Play: <br/>&bull; The deck of 54 cards (53 game cards and 1 Player Aid card).<br/>&bull; The game board showing the Silk Road map.<br/>&bull; 18 eurocubes in each of 6 colors (blue, red, yellow, green, white, purple) to represent the Trade Goods, plus 1 additional red and yellow eurocube for the Victory Point track.<br/>&bull; 15 gray/black eurocubes to represent Artisans.<br/>&bull; 3 pawns in red and yellow to represent the Trade Caravans.<br/><br/>Setup: Decide who will be the Han Dynasty and the Roman Empire and place the Silk Road Trade Map between both players. This map allows players to track their Trade Caravans across the Silk Road through Asia. It also designates areas for players to build fields of cards in the game to gain Victory Points.<br/><br/>Play: <br/>Each round of the game consists of 4 phases. Each player will complete all phases in turn. Player 1 going first, followed by Player 2.<br/>(Note: Card abilities in a Player&rsquo;s Empire may be used at any time during <br/>phases 1-3, and all card abilities are cumulative.)<br/><br/>&bull; Phase 1: Production                                                                           <br/>During Phase 1, the active player has 8 Production Points (PP) to spend. Production points are used to produce trade goods and hire artisans, which are in turn, used to buy cards, build cards and send Trade Caravans across the Silk Road for VP.<br/><br/>&bull; Phase 2: Buy/Build/Defend                                                                              <br/>The active player may now do any of the following 3 actions. Actions must, however, be in the following order:<br/><br/>A. Buy: Buy one or more cards from the Crossroads by discarding the correct number and type of trade goods listed on the card, from a player&rsquo;s supply. After buying a card, the player places this card on their discard pile next to their Player Empire (unless a card ability in a Player&rsquo;s Empire states otherwise), and replaces the card just purchased with a new card from the Crossroads draw pile. If there are no more cards in the Crossroads draw pile, cards cannot be replaced.<br/><br/>B. Build: Build one or more cards from your player empire by discarding the correct number of artisans equal to the build cost as listed on the card. Place this card in one of the 4 fields located to the left or right of the Silk Road Trade Map as designated by the player&rsquo;s color (Note: a player may only build cards to their side of the Trade Map). Built cards gain victory points for the player. Add these victory points to the player&rsquo;s total on the Victory Point Track. Built cards no longer have their card abilities available to the player; they are now worth only victory points and, in some cases, defensive strength.<br/><br/>Players may not switch cards in any field once built.<br/><br/>Players may not build a card more than 3 cards in distance out from the Silk Road Trade Map<br/><br/>Cards in fields do not have to match in name, type or color.<br/><br/>Cards must be adjacent for additional stacked victory points.<br/><br/>C. Defend: Defeat one Enemy card from the Crossroads if the total defensive strength in your player field is equal to or greater than the Enemy card&rsquo;s strength. Remove the Enemy card from the game and replace the empty space with a new card from the Crossroads draw pile. Gain any victory points and awards as listed on the Enemy card.<br/><br/>&bull; Phase 3: Trade                                                                                <br/>The active player may now do only one of the following:<br/><br/>a. Begin a new Trade Caravan: <br/>A player may ship up to 4 trade goods at any one time in a single Trade Caravan. They may ship fewer if they choose to. The Warehouse and Trading Post cards can add extra trade goods to a Trade Caravan.<br/><br/>A player may move all of their Trade Caravan pawns one space towards the opposing player. (Note: Each Trader card in your Player Empire allows Trade Caravans to move one additional space during this phase). <br/>Any Enemy abilities are now applied for any Enemy cards in the Crossroads. These may result in the loss of Trade Goods or entire Trade Caravans. Trade Goods have the following values when determining which to lose: Gold and Silk (3), Wine and <br/>Porcelain (2), Glassware and Spices (1).<br/>If a player must lose an entire Trade Caravan, they may choose which to remove.<br/><br/>&bull; Phase 4: Discard                                                                           <br/>The active player must now discard all cards from their Player Empire to their discard pile and deal out 4 new cards from their draw pile to their Player Empire. If there are not enough cards left to draw from, shuffle the discard pile and create a new draw pile. If there are still not enough cards to deal out 4 new cards the player will not have 4 cards in their Player Empire in the next round.<br/><br/>Any Crossroads cards that have been discarded (not those that have been defeated during Phase 2) should be shuffled back into the Crossroads draw deck.<br/><br/>End Game: Once a player has built 10 cards to their respective field the game ends immediately.

It is an African checkers variant played on a special pattern that is different from the well-known Alquerque pattern. Whereas the Alquerque pattern reduces the number of diagonals, the Kharbaga pattern reduces the number of orthogonals. The result is a different game dynamic. It is a very attractive checkers variant, not the least drawish. Although the number of squares is only 42, the many movement freedoms of the pieces make it a complex game.<br/>Counters are obliged to follow the pattern on the board. The pieces can step in the three forward directions, and capture, by the short leap, in all directions. Goal is to capture all the opponent's counters. Counters are promoted to Mullahs (Sultans) at the last rank. If the counter, during a capturing sequence, makes an intermediate landing on a promotion square, it does not promote to Mullah. The Mullah moves and captures in all directions. It can move any number of squares, like the King in international draughts, and land anywhere behind a captured piece. Capture is obligatory. Two types of variants have been implemented, one in which captured counters stay on the board until the capturing sequence has ended, and one in which counters are removed instantly. Note that one must always choose the line with the most captures.<br/><br/>A counter moves to an empty adjacent point. If an adjacent point is occupied by an enemy counter and the point directly behind is vacant, then one must jump over it and capture it, as in checkers.

As such the earlier historical description comments still apply:<br/><br/>&quot;This set of rules are intended to cover the engagements that took place between 1861 and 1865 during the American Civil War. The location of the actions would be on the great rivers of the eastern seaboard of North America. Such rivers would be the James, Mississippi and Yazoo. The rules have been designed with the specific objective of providing a playable game that gives the flavour of the period by imparting the major features and generalising on lesser matters. A brief outline of the conflict would go as follows. The two sides were known as the confederates(CSA) and the Union(USA). The union tended to have a much larger fleet. At the outset the union fleet consisted of mainly wooden vessels. The confederates quickly built ironclads(armoured vessels with extremely thick armour). These ironclads quickly proved wooden ships to be greatly inferior. This was illustrated several times when a single confederate ironclad would scatter four or five wooden ships. The CSA ships tended to be conversions . The quality of engines, materials and armaments varied wildly often toward the poorer end. The USA soon fielded some excellent ironclads along the famous monitor design which overall were better ships than the long CSA Ram/Ironclads.<br/><br/>As far as guns were concerned there are a few generalities that may give the player more feel for the period. The principles of fire and effect fell into two ideals. The first ideal was that of &ldquo;punching&rdquo;. Punching was the concept of the round going through the armour and causing great damage inside. Battering was the concept of smashing against the armour so hard that the plates would break off or the force would be transmitted to the area beyond the armour. Both methods have merit but it is punching that rules modern day thinking now that such items as fused shells and very high velocity guns are available.&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Martin Goddard"], "categories": ["American Civil War", "Miniatures", "Nautical"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Hammerin' Iron 2011", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 150, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.28571, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 2.71052, "numcomments": 2}, "102957": {"mechanics": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "", "wishing": 1, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 102957, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "", "publishers": ["(Unknown)"], "families": [], "description": "&quot;War on Drugs&quot; is a roll and move Trivia Game designed to help parents and educators have discussions with children about the dangers of Drug Use.

Managing speed is the key to victory! Enter the corners too fast and you crash, go hard on the brakes and weapon-pickups will be gone when you arrive and being careless might get you rammed in to traps by your fellow racers.

Only the first player to arrive at a square that is linked to a circle above, can take the picture card.<br/>The first player to reach England gains 10 points. Now everyone counts up the points on their souvenir cards and the player with the most points, wins.<br/>One unusual rule. If you arrive home with the Slave-Girl (souvenir?!) cannot arrive in England with such a find. It must be returned to the board and he can choose any other souvenir card that is still unowned. England would appear to be the only country in Europe that bans slaves! By the way, if you want a Slave-Girl of your own, the place to go is Istanbul (square 65).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": [], "categories": ["Travel"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Mediterranean Cruise", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "109966": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1112317.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 109966, "yearpublished": 1920, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1112317_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Glevum Games"], "families": ["Sports: Golf"], "description": "Super-sized tabletop golf game.<br/>Play real golf shots with your miniature metal golf clubs.

It plays in approximately 20 minutes.<br/>Players take turn placing and removing pawns (the Colonies) on an hexagonal board (the Asteroid belt) with 5 hexagonal cells (the Asteroids) per side.<br/>Playing the Colonies allow to have the controls of the cells through double-sided discs (the Mines).<br/>Aim of the game is having control of the most valuable group of Mines (a Chain): the value of a Chain is given by the sum of the values of the adjacent Colonies.<br/><br/>The game will participate in an Abstract Strategy Game Design Contest in the mathematics festival &quot;Tutto &egrave; Numero&quot; in Cald&egrave; (Italy) at the end of July 2011<br/><br/>What's so special about Hexteroyd ?<br/><br/>Hexteroyd is a kind of connection game but with several twists:<br/> - First and foremost, you don't need to connect distant parts of the board. You must connect points to... gain points !<br/> - The pawns you use are shared between the players and have a double role: they allow the players to make actions and they are the points themselves: positive if you connect them on the board, negative if you keep them in your hand.<br/> - You don't directly place the connecting pieces on the board: they come into play as a consequence of your playing a pawn, whether you place it on, or remove it from, the board.<br/> - Connecting pieces (the discs) aren't fix, they have a certain degree of variability as the result of players' actions: once they are on the board, they remain on their cell, but they change owner, therefore changing the connected pawns.<br/> Thanks to these characteristics, some parts of the board (usually the peripheral ones) are constantly subject to subtle but meaningful changes and the victory is somewhat uncertain till the end.<br/><br/>The strategic aspect of Hexteroyd originates in the different ways in which you can use pawns: if you tend to empty your hand, you will have more territory control but less mobility; if you keep them in hand you risk to lose points in the end if you can't get rid of them.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Remo Conzadori", "Emiliano \"Wentu\" Venturini"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Hexteroyd", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 20, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "110047": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling"], "usersrated": 18, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1117087.jpg", "wishing": 4, "owned": 64, "trading": 0, "id": 110047, "yearpublished": 2011, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 3, "wanting": 3, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1117087_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Ambush Alley Games", "Osprey Publishing"], "families": [], "description": "In the 44-year long history of the Cold War, few conflicts symbolize it as fully as those in Vietnam.

His kingdoms included not only Spain but both parts of the Low Countries, Italy and colonies in the Philipines and the Americas. Now two dynasties claimed the Spanish throne, the French Bourbons and the Austrian Habsburgs. Charles last will proclaimed that Philip, Duke of Anjou (grandson of Louis XIV) was to be offered the whole Spanish empire. However, the German emperor, Leopold I had launched his son the Archduke Charles as pretender to the throne. England preferred the Electoral Prince Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria who was Leopold&rsquo;s grandson. In February 1701 the 17 year old Philip was crowned in Madrid and was reluctantly recognized by England. In the same time French troops secured the Spanish Nederlands and cut of England and the United Provinces from Spanish trade. This resulted in the Treaty of Den Haag 1701 which formed the great alliance between Austria, England and the United Provinces and was later supported by Prussia, Hanover, Denmark, the Holy Roman Empire, Portugal and Savoy. The treaty did actually recognized Philip as the king of Spain but more important, it retained the Spanish trade, gave the Spanish territories in Italy as well as the Spanish Nederlands to Austria and formed a defensive alliance against France. On the other side Bavaria and Cologne supported the French in this upcoming conflict. When Portugal joined the great alliance the focus turned to put Archduke Charles on the Spanish throne.<br/><br/>The war now started slowly in Italy where an Austrian force commanded by Eugene of Savoy invaded the Duchy of Milan, one of the Spanish territories in Italy, which prompted a French intervention. Things are now set up for A Throne Vacant&trade; to begin.<br/><br/>The game:<br/><br/>A Throne Vacant&trade;( # 107-1 ) is easy to learn and is played in a fast phased manner. The units are blocks in regimental and army size for greatest flexibility in taking steps and differentiating the quality and strength of the troops, like in its sister game Pax Baltica. The high quality map is divided in territories which you have to conquer order to control it. This is made by taking each and every town in a territory. Navies will also play an important part in ATV in the sense that you have to keep the sea lines open to the colonies, and of course transport British troops to the continent. As this intriguing conflict covers the whole of western Europe the map covers a large area from the Atlantic coast in the west to Prague in the east, from northern England in the north to Oran in the south. Playable nations are England/Great Britain, France, Spain, Austria and The United Provinces. Other countries represented in the game are Portugal, Savoy, Bavaria, Denmark and The Holy Roman Empire.<br/><br/>So, why don&rsquo;t you enter the roles of some of the great military commanders of history, Marlborough, Prince Eugene, Villars or Vend&ocirc;me. Lead them to great victories and secure the Spanish crown for your pretender to the throne. We are quite sure that this game will bring a Machiavellian smile to your face.<br/><br/>The game, packed in a book case includes a 50 x 70cm-size full color map, 80 high quality wooden blocks, 4 dice, various markers and rules, including different scenarios.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.75, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["G\u00f6ran Bj\u00f6rkman", "Stefan Ekstr\u00f6m"], "categories": ["Age of Reason", "Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "3", "#text": "A Throne Vacant", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 6.83333, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.21335, "numcomments": 3}, "101861": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 3, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1098098.jpg", "wishing": 2, "owned": 9, "trading": 0, "id": 101861, "yearpublished": 1999, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1098098_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Milton Bradley"], "families": [], "description": "From the back of the box:<br/>Are you ready for your mystery date?<br/>The game with the electronic talking phone<br/>The game changes every time you play!<br/>So use the clues you hear and see if you can solve each mystery<br/><br/>Mystery Date: The Game With The Electronic Talking Phone<br/><br/>This is the 1999 version of Mystery Date but is vastly different than the others.

The most important is Action Points (AP) which represent the character's life energy.<br/>A player's turn begins by choosing one of several tactics.

The player then chooses which figures to activate, and expends the figure's APs to move, charge, use a ranged weapon or a Chi power. Each fight is duel; duel are resolved by secretly choosing a combat action for each combatant (which can give bonuses or penalties to die rolls), then rolling for initiative, then trying to beat the opponent's Armour score with 1d6 + the fighter attack score.

Lucidia is a living, high fantasy world manifested though a series of epic works. These epic works include a series of novels, graphic novels, short stories, board games and a role-playing game. The first of his works, Islandis: A World of Lucidia Boardgame, will be released in 2012 via Time Warp Games.<br/> Theme:<br/><br/>Entitled Islandis: A World of Lucidia Boardgame, this prologue will transport players to the humble beginnings of Lucidia, to a place far removed from the mainland, to a time before time, to the very birth place of life. <br/>Islandis is the largest and most populated island in the Tokelau Sea, serving as the cornerstone for the exploration and settlement of the Asazi Isles. The island is teaming with culture, beauty, bountiful sea life, a seemingly endless supply of resources, and all of the essentials for a growing populous.<br/>In time, through innovation and exploration, neighboring islands are discovered and populated. The new found islands introduce the Asazi people to previously undiscovered resources, thus giving life to a perpetual network of trade routes, and an incessant market place.<br/>Island life is sublime, until...<br/>Villages wake to the sound of chaos. The island pulses and cries with anguish. Families stumble out of their bungalows and into the night, only to find themselves dodging debris from the sky. Turning toward the summit, screams echo across the sea as bursts of lava erupt into the night sky. Dark clouds loom overhead, and no stars are watching from the night sky. Almost word for word, prophesy unfolds. This way of life is coming to an end,it is time for a new beginning.<br/>In Islandis, each player takes on the role of a great leader of the Asazi people. It is each player&rsquo;s charge to lead their tribe in this prophetic time.<br/>Each player has a whole host of strategic colors in his pallet. Some may decide to stay on the island and continue to gather resources, make trade, and nourish culture. Others may gather resources to build vessels, explore and settle undiscovered islands.  The most successful leaders will exhaust both of these options in perfect harmony. Whether choosing to make significant contributions in trade, develop high culture, or spread the seeds of their people across the vastness of the great sea, one common goal remains: To not be forgotten, to make your mark on the history of the World of Lucidia.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/><br/>At its core, Islandis is a 1-4 player, turn based worker placement game for ages 13+; however, due to the nature of epic works, players will find that Islandis is truly a set of mini games within the whole part. In accord with the worker placement mechanic, players will enjoy fending off sea creatures, making trade, exploration, variable player powers, dice rolling, set building, and empire building (including conversion sites, villages, monoliths, colossi, and temples).<br/>There are five primary building resources found on Islandis (Stone, Iron Ore, Gold Ore, Cotton, and Timber). These five resources, in many cases, will need to be converted into their more useful forms (Ashlar, Iron, Gold, Textiles, and Lumber). In order to upgrade resources, you will need to utilize your conversions sites, and workers. Dice serve as workers in the game and the results of a roll indicate the productivity of workers. Throughout the game players will find ways to &quot;inspire&quot; their workers to be more productive with the assistance of innovative tribesmen and women!<br/>In addition to the five primary resources, and their upgraded incarnations, players will find many uses for the four major imported goods (Copal, Bamboo, Dyes, and Fruit). These imported goods are earned by lending workers to the four neighboring islands as trade.<br/>Finally, and most important, players will need to feed their people! Players will rush for the opportunity to fish from the shore, however, due to limited space, most will be required to employ their sea vessels to earn fish. The most successful players will begin planting fruit trees early in the game to supplement the demands of fishing. <br/>During the game, players will be able to develop culturally, allowing for a variety of new uses for the 14 resources. These cultural advancements include heirloom recipes, jewelry, musical instruments, and more, each lending their tribes the ability to earn victory points through trading cultural goods.<br/><br/>Goal:<br/><br/>The goal of each player is to earn as many victory points as possible before Islandis is destroyed by molten lava. Victory points are earned in a variety of fashions: Trading resources at the markets, developing cultural items and trading at the markets, fighting off sea creatures, surviving deadly storms, building villages, monoliths, colossi, and temples on newly discovered islands.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Elree Ellis"], "categories": ["Adventure", "City Building", "Exploration", "Fantasy"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Islandis: A World of Lucidia Boardgame", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 120, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "110151": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1123396.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 110151, "yearpublished": 1950, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1123396_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Coca-Cola", "G.

It takes a desire for loot, hordes of your minions willing to be led to certain death (err, victory), cunning strategy, and a touch of treachery. The first player whose Dark Force unit enters the keep, by the end of turn eight, is truly the mightiest champion and claims total victory for his army.<br/><br/>The Story So Far - The Invasion Begins!<br/><br/>Castle StormHaven is guarded vigilantly by brave defenders comprised of an alliance between Men, Elves, Halflings, and Dwarves. For over 300 years, these defenders have repelled numerous invasions from the Badlands, home to the subterranean Dark Elf marauders and the mysterious sect of arcane bending wizards, the Arcanists. StormHaven is the first and last line of defense from keeping the fertile farmlands and gold mines of Western Holmenstein from being overrun.<br/><br/>Years ago, a mysterious masked and exceptionally short villain appeared with the goal of uniting the Badlands and ruling over Holmenstein. Dubbed &quot;the Boss&quot; by his cohorts, he promised gold and power to those who would follow him. First the Dark Elves, then the Arcanists joined his Dark Forces. Soon after, the Orc pirate raiders joined the growing army and brought with them their crazed goblin allies and monstrous cousins, the giants. Knowing The Boss' army needed further strength to overwhelm Castle StormHaven's defenses, he revealed the last piece of strategy for domination, the Undead Horde of the BlackSoot Swamps.<br/><br/>Now the four dark force armies &ndash; Dark Elves, Arcanists, Orc and Goblins of the Green Tide, and the innumerable Undead host &ndash; begin their long march east.<br/><br/>Dark Force Army Overview<br/><br/>Choosing your army is part of the fun of Storm the Castle! Each Dark Force army has unique units, power cards, combos and strategies. Is one better than the other - no! It&rsquo;s how you use your strengths while minimizing your weakness. Each army has a fair opportunity to win.<br/><br/>The Green Tide: Orcs, goblins, giants, and other humanoids make up this loose tribal alliance. Specializing in brute force and strange Eastern technology, players who enjoy large explosions, brute strength, and dangerous yet untested weapons will enjoy smashing their way to victory with this army.<br/><br/>Pros: Hard hitting units with lots of equipment upgrades. Power cards primarily focused on attacking and smashing. The rock lobber is one of the most effective siege weapons in the game. Goblin sappas provide for cheap, hard hitting units.<br/>Cons: Moderately expensive units. Lack of diversity in their power cards utility. Equipment can be deadly for both you and foe!<br/><br/>The Arcanists: Mixing metal with magic produces stunning results. These masters of the forbidden arcane arts use their talents to manipulate the minds and outcomes of events of their allies and enemies. Players who enjoy using tactics that harness deadly magics and powers to manipulate events will surely enjoy the awesome power of the Arcanists.<br/><br/>Pros: Incredible power cards that can shift game elements to your favor. Several long range spells and abilities to generate quick magic. <br/>Cons: Many of your units have low health and are easily destroyed.<br/><br/>The Undead Horde: The walking dead from the Blacksoot Swamps know of one thing - how to feed! Their power derives from their ever increasing numbers and ability to sustain damage while pressing forward. Players looking to overwhelm the Fantasy Defenders with hordes of undead while using dark magic will find great pleasure in fielding this army.<br/><br/>Pros: Your units cause fear and can take quite a bit of damage.  Inexpensive units allow you to swarm and overrun the Fantasy Defender&rsquo;s defenses. <br/>Cons: Though your units are many, they don&rsquo;t hit hard. Magic can be hard to build up as its dependent upon how many undead units you have in play.<br/><br/>The Dark Elves: From the deep recesses of forgotten lands nestled deep within the earth come the masters of marauding, the Dark Elves. Known for their exceptional arts in battlefield tactics and archery, no foe is safe from the tips of their arrows to the teeth of their treachery. Players who revel in treachery, backstabbing and shooting should choose the Dark Elves.<br/><br/>Pros:  Awesome ranged attacks and power cards to support them. Treacherous power cards give you a unique competitive edge against other players.<br/>Cons: Squishy units means you&rsquo;ve got to know when to fight and when to move in. Players may give you strange &ldquo;can I trust you&rdquo; looks.

Though relatively unknown, these conflicts, raging from 1739-1748, comprised the first &quot;world war&quot;. The primary naval actions took place in three theatres: the English Channel and Bay of Biscay, the Caribbean, and the western Mediterranean. Forces also clashed in India, along America's eastern seaboard, and in the Pacific. Each of the other games covers one of these theatres. Mistral covers the western Mediterranean, where Spain tried to keep her lines of communication open to her army in Italy, and France's Toulon Fleet continually harassed the British.<br/><br/>Mistral is a two player strategy game. You command either the British or Bourbon (French and Spanish) fleets. Orders are handed down to you from your Admiralty, and you must try to fulfill them within the framework of the wider war, which is represented by a set of events. Your opponent will have orders of his own to fulfill, but with his spare forces he will be attempting to foil your plans. Success will earn you Prestige (victory points), and may even have an impact on the land campaign. You must decide when and where to commit resources, where to feint and where to strike, organising your &quot;sail&quot; (ships) into squadrons, and your squadrons into flotillas commanded by leaders (commodores and admirals). Maintaining sufficient forces at &quot;battle readiness&quot; is critical, but very difficult, since ships constantly suffer wear and tear &ndash; a battle may be won and the campaign lost.

Across the world, the infant Queens of Fate are being reincarnated into the world. Can you find them before the dark powers get to them?<br/><br/>--<br/>These are the complete instructions on how to play a solitaire game called Queens of Fate, using only a deck of tarot cards and a large playing surface. I made up this game as a tool to help me learn to use and interpret the multi-faceted meaning of the tarot cards in different ways, and soon found both the game and its story to be quite addictive.<br/><br/>Gameplay consists of turning over cards from the deck, one at a time and resolving them.  Depending on the type of card (classified in the game as Opposition, Arcana, Source, or Court), you will either play it into your play area, confront it in a challenge, or compare it to the previous card drawn. You have a set of Arcana cards and Source cards to use in battles, but each can only be used once.<br/><br/>The strategy of the game involves using (discarding) cards you have in play when an Opposition card comes up, or deciding whether not to confront at all and deal with the consequences.  Playing cards in certain combinations allows you to &quot;resurrect&quot; cards from the discard pile.<br/><br/>The goal is to play the four Queens, and place one in each suite-themed play area.  If you run out of cards before this happens, you lose the game.  The Queens can be lost through losing battles to Obstacle cards, which may attack your Court cards or random cards from your deck.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 2.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Anthony D.

Totality is a unique board game that combines the features of a card game with the mechanisms of a board game; it plays in the current era and simulates the total range of the human condition. The heart of the game is the deck of 64 unique and intriguing cards.  There are 4 suits of 16 cards.  These suits represent the 4 planes of existence - physical,  biological, cognitive, and social.  Each plane (suit) has 4 unique elements and a color.  Each card in the suit is composed of a combination of those four elements.  Cards have a number of elements from zero to four.   The mix of elements is shown on each card.  Each card has a game action line.  The game area (world) consists of a 4X4  array of cards laid face up and a space in front of each player to keep sets and action cards.  Players move through the world to gather cards.  Each player is represented by a marker or token.<br/><br/>Object of the game: to build the character with the most experience by gathering sets of cards while moving around the board (world).<br/><br/>Setup.  1)  Shuffle the deck; 2) Deal one card to each player.  The player with the highest card number goes first.  Players keep this card as part of their hand; 3) Then deal the 4X4 world face down.  Before play begins, each player, starting with the first, places his token in the world on a different location.  After the tokens are played, the location cards are turned face up; 4)  Deal 2 more cards to each player for a total of 3. The rest of the deck is placed face down as the draw deck (DD); place it so that the longer side of the cards is next to the world; 5) A discard (recycle) heap (DH) will be created during play; place it so that the shorter side of the cards is next to the world.  Cards are discarded face down.<br/><br/>Play.  Each turn consists of just one of the following actions unless there are effects in play that allow more: 1) Activate or remove a special effect.  The game line of most cards can create effects that change the play.  2) Move.  Movement is in a vertical or horizontal direction only (like a rook in chess).   At the beginning of the game, players can move one location per turn.  3) Gather a card from the world.  Players may gather the card under their token. 4)  Build or dismantle a set.  This is the heart of the game.  A player grows by playing sets in his character area.  Sets consist of one or more cards that satisfy specific criteria from set theory.  5.  Combat.  Combat may occur when a player (attacker) tries to move to or through a site occupied by other players (defenders), or attacks players at his current location. Combat involves betting; outcomes are governed by a simple table.  6) Open a trading session. Any player may  open a trading session his turn. Anything may be traded: token locations, sets, cards, seats, drinks.  There are two ways to end the game.  A player may end the game when he has sets with all 16 elements of the deck present.  Otherwise, the game ends instantly when the draw deck is depleted for the first time.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": [], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Card Game", "Civilization", "Memory"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Totality", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 5.5, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 4.5, "numcomments": 0}, "110303": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Modular Board"], "usersrated": 3, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1117273.jpg", "wishing": 4, "owned": 26, "trading": 1, "id": 110303, "yearpublished": 2011, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 1, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1117273_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Heat of Battle"], "families": ["Advanced Squad Leader", "Special Forces"], "description": "This is the second installment of the Special Forces series by Heat of Battle, subtitled &quot;War in the Aegean Sea!&quot;<br/><br/>The pack contains 6 scenarios representing the famed German K&uuml;stenj&auml;ger in action, a sheet with 62 full color counters (including K&uuml;stenj&auml;ger Infantry and Motor Gun Boats) and 3 pages of rules.<br/><br/>The scenarios are:<br/>SF-7: DEADLY APPETICI;

Movies are made by collecting a set of matching Actors, Title, Director and Producer cards as well as enough money to produce the movie. Money and cards are collected by moving on the gameboard and answering movie-related questions. A player can only have one card of each type in hand, so if additional cards are collected (for example a second Director card), they can be either discarded or traded with the other players.<br/><br/>Movement on the board uses a roll-and-move mechanic, with a few tweaks, like no &quot;reroll&quot; spaces, and several spaces allow the player to move her game piece anywhere she wants on the board. At first players only have access to the board spaces that allow them to collect cards or money (provided they correctly answer a question). Once a player has at least produced at least one movie, she gains access to all of the gameboard, including spaces which allow players to collect cash from their produced movies.<br/><br/>Once a player has made more movies than other competitors, she can win the game by going to the &quot;Palme d'Or&quot; space and answering a special question.

No, we are not talking about your life, but about what you are up against in Infarkt (&quot;Heart Attack&quot;), a party game in which you want to be the last one left at the party &ndash; literally.<br/><br/>Each player has an individual player board on which she'll track her blood pressure, depression, lung health, weight and so on. Everyone starts out as healthy as possible, with some money ($1) in the pocket, too. Each round, a number of event cards equal to one more than the number of players is revealed. In turn, each player will choose an event card and suffer the effects of that card, moving her health indicators as needed. Did you run out of gas? Or have a bout of diarrhea? Man, life sucks.<br/><br/>Players then simultaneously deploy three action markers to indicate where they plan to go that day: the supermarket, the office, a pharmacy, a flea market, the gym, and so on. In turn order, players then execute all three of their actions in whatever order they desire. Maybe you'll hit the office to earn money, but at the cost of having your depression grow more intense. A trip to the supermarket will let you buy food, which you can then eat later at home or give to your neighbors who come to the party you throw. Force them to eat cake and get fat! If you have extra money on hand, you might want to visit the pharmacy to buy drugs; you never know what the pharmacist will give you, but if you don't like it (or the food you've acquired), you can hit the flea market to swap food and drugs &ndash; and maybe pick up some change in the bargain.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, you check your health levels to see whether your body is deteriorating without you even knowing. Get too depressed, for example, and the depression only gets worse; high blood pressure can affect your blood cholesterol level, and vice versa. If a health indicator rises to the tombstone at the top of the column, you've partied your last and are now out of the game. (Everyone else has to chip in for the funeral, suffering depression if they can't afford to pony up for a decent burial for a good friend like you.)

The summer camp theme is also very attractive to older children, parents, and grandparents. Each trip around the board is one, very realistic day at camp. Campers decide how many days to play, and enjoy a social experience like no other. During a camper&rsquo;s stay at CampAntics, points are won and lost with the ups and downs of daily life at a great summer camp. Each space on the board relates to an activity that you would do at camp.  Some spaces will reward you for an activity and others will penalize you for let&rsquo;s say... throwing a water balloon.  You roll dice to move and each trip around the board is a day at camp.  You choose the number of days based on level of play.

Learn shapes, colors, animals, beginning letter sounds, counting and addition!<br/><br/>Object: Be the first player to shout &quot;BINGO&quot; by getting 4-in-a-row.<br/><br/>Game One: Color/Shape Match<br/>Use the spinner, and cards with shapes on them. The youngest player begins by spinning the spinner and calling out the shape and color to which the arrow points. For example, &quot;Blue Star!&quot;. Then all players search their cards for that color and shape. If they have a match, they cover it with a Tad bingo chip. Play continues clockwise with each player taking a turn spinning and calling. For shorter games, just match colors or just match shapes.<br/><br/>Game Two: Number Match<br/>Use the spinner, and cards with numbers on them. The youngest player begins by spinning the spinner and calling out the number to which the arrow points. For example, &quot;number 9!&quot;. Then all players search their cards for that number. If they have a match, they cover it with a Tad bingo chip. Play continues clockwise with each player taking a turn spinning and calling.<br/><br/>Game Three: Animal Match<br/>Use the spinner, and cards with animals on them. The youngest player begins by spinning the spinner and calling out the animal and color to which the arrow points. For example, &quot;Purple Lion!&quot;. Then all players search their cards for that color and animal. If they have a match, they cover it with a Tad bingo chip. Play continues clockwise with each player taking a turn spinning and calling. For shorter games, just match animals. Or for a beginning letter challenge, instead of announcing the animal the caller says &quot;the animal that begins with M&quot;. Players then place Tad bingo chips on ALL animals on their cards that begin with M.<br/><br/>Game Four: Add-Up and Match<br/>Use the spinner with the addition equations, and cards with numbers on them. The youngest player begins by spinning the spinner and solves the equation to which the arrow points and calls out the answer. For example, if the spinner points to 9+1, then the player solves it and calls out 10. Then all players search for 10 and cover it with a Tad bingo chip.

Game has 7 different adult games from drinking games (2) to actual serious adult fun with scoring and also a trivia game for couples.<br/><br/>Trivia game:<br/>Game comes with a special trivia cards and dice. Players play in couples and roll a dice. Dice shows the category from which the roller needs to answer. The weird thing is that couple needs to choose another couple from which to give the answer for. For each correct answer you keep the cards. First couple that knows other couples best and collect 6 cards are the winner couple.<br/><br/>Card game:<br/>Uses 2 classic game decks. Can be played with 2 or with 4 couples. Each couple gets a deck of cards or 2 suits in one color. Hearts and spades in this game act as trumps.<br/>Hearts are a life together and spades are the separation. Game is played in one full circle. With 2 couples the idea is to get rid of all the spades and collect all the hearts. Problem is that they both act as trumps, so getting rid of spades is hard, but there are special rules for Jacks and Queens in other suits that help to make that easier. When all cards are played, couples read their hearts and spades. Each heart is 2 points, each spade is -2 points, each Jack and Queen is extra 2 points (whatever suit) and each Ace is a free drink card (still a party game). Winner is the couple with the most points.<br/>In 4 couple game, game is played the same, but the winning conditions are different. Couples now only score how many cards they have - each red 2 points, each black -2 points. Rest is the same with the exception that 0 is the worst result. That means the further you are from the 0 the higher your score is.<br/><br/>Couples game:<br/>Uses the special trivia game cards. This is played in circles, couples sitting against each other. When the times comes to a player, he/she pulls a cards and ask one question from his partner about herself/himself. Partner then writes down an answer along side with the question asker. When the answer are more or less the same, they score one point (a kiss or a hug). Game lasts 10 rounds. Couple with more points (kisses) wins the game.<br/><br/>Other 4 are drinking games (one seems to be a sex game) where there is no actual winners or scoring of any kind.

The game ends when one player reaches 150 points.<br/><br/>Overview:<br/>The game begins when the first player rolls the 9 3-Squared Dice.  8 of the dice are colored with blue (3 sides), purple (2 sides) and red (1 side).  The 9th die has 3 blue sides with a 10 on it, 2 purple sides with a 20 and 1 red side with 40 printed on it.  The object is to NOT roll all of the sides with the same color and complete the 3-Square.<br/><br/>After the dice are rolled all players examine the results.  The Score Die is set in the center of the play area and all other dice that are the same color are set along side it.  If all of the other 8 dice are the same color as the Score Die, the player has completed the 3-Square, the round ends and the player who rolled the dice scores the points showing on the Score Die.  If any of the other 8 dice are not the same color, play passes to the next player.  The second player rolls all of the remaining dice that do not match the color of the Score Die and the other dice that were not set aside.  Play continues in this manner until all of the dice match the color of the Score Die and the player who completed the 3-Square.<br/><br/>There are two little tricks however that can alter the gameplay.  The first is the 10th die...called the Event Die, it has six different sides that can change the results of the dice rolls.  One can end the round immediately, even if the 3-Square has not been completed.  One can allow the player who completed the 3-Square to pass the points to a different player, others double, or even triple the points showing on the Score Die.<br/><br/>Each player is also given 3 Pass Tokens which they can use to skip their turn rolling the dice, shifting the turn to the next player.  The 3 Tokens are not renewable so players must be careful when using them.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>     3-Squared Dice (10 Total)<br/>     Pass Tokens (18 Total)   <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Eric Messersmith"], "categories": ["Dice"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "3-Squared", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 15, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "110729": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1139219.png", "wishing": 0, "owned": 2, "trading": 1, "id": 110729, "yearpublished": 2004, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1139219_t.png", "publishers": ["Noris Spiele"], "families": ["Animals: Dogs"], "description": "&quot;Around the dog&quot; in English<br/>2.200 questions and answers on the subject of dogs, frequent play can make an expert of the players.

Your key pieces are squadrons that you move around the board in stacks. The board itself being gridded into systems (where resources are located) and subsectors (empty space). Squadrons move from square-to-square on the board as in Chess. As the game proceeds, stargates twist space so that squares change their position relative to one another.<br/><br/>Another big difference from Chess is that conflicts are resolved using tactical core cards that will feel to you more like rock-paper-scissors. Unlike in Chess, attacking pieces won't always win. Furthermore you will get free moves and other kinds of special actions through playing Imperial edict cards.<br/><br/>The most destructive force in the game are antimatter missiles. You build missiles in stages on your systems and launch them during your turn. These missiles are the reason why the goal of the game &mdash; collecting three different deep-defense codes &mdash; is so important. Missile detonations destroy everything in a square and even burn up the square itself so that nothing can enter it. Owning three colors of deep-defense codes makes some of your squares immune to antimatter detonations, upsetting the balance of power and giving you a chance to win.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 3.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Klaude Thomas"], "categories": ["Fighting", "Negotiation", "Political", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "DarkStar", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 120, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.19231, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.81382, "numcomments": 15}, "102539": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1034741.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "trading": 0, "id": 102539, "yearpublished": 2008, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1034741_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Zing Toys"], "families": ["3D Games", "Admin: Better Description Needed!"], "description": "3-D Bullz Eye Dartz, takes the tradition wall-mounted dartboard and lays it on its side.

In addition to attempting to kill the crew, the monster can also destroy sections of the ship, forcing the human players to divide their efforts between defense and structural repair. The monster can win the game by either killing all seven members of the crew or damaging enough sections of the ship that it breaks apart. Adding the destruction of the ship as an alternate victory condition allows for varied strategies on the part of both players. The human player can use tools to effect repairs, construct weapons and trackers to hunt down the monster&hellip;or ultimately blow up the ship if all seems lost.<br/><br/>The SPECIMEN player constructs his/her monster from a selection of 25 different attributes (offensive, defensive, or special abilities), providing new and different threats to the human player each game.

Yes, you might think that vampires should be roaming the halls late at night, but junior vampires need their sleep as much as non-vampiric youngsters.<br/><br/>To set up the game, each player places her bed tile next to the rug on the game board of the same color, then places her pawn on a rug that is not her own color. Someone shuffles the six garlic cards and places them face-down on the game board, then players mix the spider and orange juice drink tokens face-down, place them on the game board, then draw one at random and place them on their bed.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player rolls the die. If she rolls a number, she moves that many spaces clockwise or counter-clockwise on the rugs on the edge of the game board. If she lands on an empty space, her turn ends. If one or more players are already on that rug, she chooses one of them, then draws a face-down token and places it before her without looking at it. The chosen player draws and reveals another token. Each player then makes what they think is the appropriate noise for these two items hitting one another: &quot;clink&quot; if two glasses, &quot;oomph&quot; if two spiders, and &quot;splash&quot; if one of each. The active player reveals the hidden token: If both players were correct, they each claim one token and place it on their bed; if only one player was correct, she claims both tokens; and if no one was right, the tokens are placed face-down on the board again.<br/><br/>If the player rolls a garlic bulb, everyone screams &quot;Garlic!&quot; then tries to get in bed because their screaming probably roused Dad, who will be annoyed to find them out of bed. Here's how this works: The active player reveals the top garlic card. If it shows a closed trap door, then each player moves one rug toward their bed (or onto their bed if they are already on their rug). If all vampires are in bed, stop turning over cards; if not, turn another card. If Dad shows up on one of the cards, every vampire out of bed loses an item while vampires in bed may take an item as a reward.<br/><br/>When a player has eight items on bed, players hold a garlic round.

On a turn, the player picks up all the pieces in one bowl and distributes them one-by-one in bowls in a clockwise order. Wherever the final piece is placed, the player takes the action associated with that bowl; in addition, if the colored pieces in that bowl match the colors shown on a Trajan tile next to the bowl (with tiles being placed at the start of the game and through later actions), then the player takes the additional action shown on that tile.<br/><br/>What are you trying to do with these actions?

In the 1st phase players recruit cards from a common pool neutral to all players. 4 classes of cards could appear in the pool: Challenges, citizens, buildings, and heroes. Each card has different game play applications and different effects on end scoring. In the 2nd phase each player has a chance to defend their town from challenges. In the 3rd phase challenges loot towns left unprotected. The 4th phase is when each town earns money. In the 5th phase money can be spent to expand a town by hiring heroes and citizens or creating buildings. The final phase resets the board for a new round of phases. The starting player changes and rounds continue until a town reaches a fixed size.

A Science Fiction Collectable Card Games without an equal. Do you like Firefly, Battlestar Galactica, Babylon 5? Hull Breach! features a unique science fiction world with many of your favorite elements of each.<br/><br/> From the rulebook:<br/><br/>Hull Breach! is a tactical, operational, and strategic space-combat and logistics card game for two or more players.<br/><br/>Each player has his or her own deck of cards consisting of a Station, ships, modules, Marines, technological breakthroughs, events, and tactics. Players compete head-to-head to destroy each other's fleets and space station; the last player or team standing is the victor.<br/><br/> Gameplay:<br/><br/>Players choose from a variety of pre-constructed decks or can assemble their own, then each player takes turns either building up their base or building ships to attack their opponents. First player to destroy (or take over from boarding action) is the winner.<br/><br/>Each faction/deck has a unique power and varied amounts of resources generated each turn. With these resources you can add on modules to your base, or play ships/marines to the table. Your base functions as a mothership where your subsequent ships make up the fleet you will use for offense and defense. Each turn you will get more resources based on your base and the modules attached (which can add to your resource generation).<br/><br/>The ships and marines have different special abilities such as stealth (to avoid enemy detection). Some ships can even retrieve more ships from your deck at no cost.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved with d10s. You count up the total amount your roll for offense (based on the current stats of the cards involved) then roll. The target roll is determined by the defense of the ship. Most small ships can only take 1 or 2 hits, but larger ships will need multiple hits to take down. Wounds do carry over but there are mechanisms to remove some wound tokens over time.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.6667, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Daniel Auxier"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Collectible Components", "Economic", "Industry / Manufacturing", "Political", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Hull Breach!", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "Not Ranked"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.74704, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 2.12526, "numcomments": 14}, "109959": {"mechanics": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1111866.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 109959, "yearpublished": 1950, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1111866_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Ilex"], "families": ["Circus"], "description": "Race game which tries to be original in that you have two pieces (an animal and a rider) you can consider moving after you have thrown the die.

Churchill wanted to invade Italy which he labeled &ldquo;the soft underbelly of the Axis&rdquo;. It was agreed that since no invasion of Northern France could be undertaken in 1943, that the invasion of Sicily would take place. The allied commanders were sure that invading Italy would all but destroy the Italians will to fight, and maybe the government and Mussolini would be overthrown.<br/><br/>The German high command was also aware that Italy&rsquo;s support for the war was dwindling. German units that were needed for the Eastern front were sent to Italy to help defend against an allied attack and to police the Italian army in case of a coup. With most of Germany&rsquo;s army and supplies on the Eastern front and a weakening ally in Italy, Germany is desperate to keep the allies out of Southern Europe.<br/><br/>The Invasion of Italy is an Axis &amp; Allies style game that puts you in the seat of the Axis commanders who are racing to get their army into a position to defend Southern Europe, and Allied commanders who are ready to open another front in Europe to relieve the Russians on the Eastern front.

It provides a unique interpretation of the common fantasy races and monsters for game play. The game can be scaled from a small handful of figures up to several dozen.  Players can customize their own figures, individualizing them with skills and building them up with experience both within a single game and from game to game. The rulebook provides a variety of scenarios, including everything from straight up battles to dungeon crawls to an assault on a wizard's stronghold.<br/><br/>Unlike other miniatures games, a figure is not killed with 1 or 2 wounds. Each figure is given a specific set of points sources that represent both its health and effectiveness. As a figure is wounded, it becomes less effective throughout the course of the game.  The combat system is simultaneous and figures make opposed rolls for both offense and defense to determine combat results.<br/><br/>In addition to the point sources, figures can be &quot;trained&quot; in different skills including weapons, armor, magic, and many other types of special abilities. Figures with different skills can be combined in an endless variety of ways to create effective combat and adventuring squads. Each of the 10 major species in the 9 Kingdoms has its own special racial abilities which makes the different teams original and dynamic.<br/><br/>All scenarios also incorporate an element of exploration in the form of encounter tokens on the board.  These tokens can be flipped during the game to uncover treasures, traps, powerful artifacts and even wandering monsters.  This adds an element of risk and unpredictability to the game as an encounter could turn out to be either be dangerous or profitable.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Ivan Turner"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Exploration", "Fantasy", "Miniatures", "Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "9 Kingdoms", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 10.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 1}, "110912": {"mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "", "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "trading": 0, "id": 110912, "yearpublished": 2011, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "", "publishers": ["(Self-Published)", "(Web published)"], "families": ["Traditional Card Games"], "description": "A two player card game, in the similar style to Lost Cities, but different.

Each of these will focus on about a divisions worth of Germans and Allies and include the maps and unit counters specific to those elements.

Most modules will have just (2) 22 x 34 maps.  Each module will have a number of scenarios that allow for smaller table space and game play duration.<br/><br/>The system has some enhancements with unit counters, such as the use of silouhettes for tanks and color coding of the different organizations for ease of tracing command and control.  The rules are well written and efficient.  They are clear and easy to read.  They are organized in a manner that aides learning.  They are structured along the 7 Battlefield Operating Systems which are Command and Control, Maneuver, Fire Support, Combat Service Support, Intelligence, Mobility and Survivability, and Air Defense.  This provides a real world view of the rules as opposed to a gamers view of the rules, but will greatly ease the learning curve and put the rules into proper context.<br/><br/>The units are modeled as Platoons for the Germans and mostly Companies and some platoons for the Allies.  Units have Secondary and Primary weapons and may use these in conjunction with each other or separately against the same or different targets.<br/><br/>A key feature of the game system is the Operations Phase.  During this time most of the action occurs.  One player may perform movement, fire, overrun, go into reserve, or setup in overwatch, and do it in any order the player wants.  This allows for a free flow of action that more closely resembles combat and the execution of smaller parts of the overall plan.  The non-phasing player must keep a close eye on the enemy as they may use opportunity fire to slow or stop the movement they don't like.  They may also use reserves to bolster the defense.  Players will see that this gives them maximum flexibility and gives both players something to do at all times.<br/><br/>Both sides in this series of games will have some time on the attack and on the defense.  The Germans are defending at start and on the 13th Sept they change to the offensive as they try to force the Americans off the beach.  This helps make sure that you aren't only being pummeled and can pummel the other guy a little too.  As the allies you get a big advantage with air and naval support to help keep the Germans at bay and you even get to drop the 82nd Airborne to help secure the beachhead.  The battle starts on 10 September, the day after the landings, and there are scenarios that start at the beginning of each day to allow for smaller, shorter games.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Christopher Fasulo"], "categories": ["Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Death Ride Salerno: 16th Panzer", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 8, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 6.5, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 3.89444, "numcomments": 1}, "102740": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Variable Player Powers"], "usersrated": 8, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1115587.jpg", "wishing": 3, "owned": 13, "trading": 0, "id": 102740, "yearpublished": 2011, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 2, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1115587_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Warhammer Historical Wargames Ltd"], "families": [], "description": "From the Publisher's Website;<br/><br/>&quot;Battles in the Napoleonic Wars were brutal and bloody.

Here's a villager who just can't sleep at nighttime, try as he might. The good news is that in his hazy non-sleep time, he learns if one or both of his neighbors was up during the night doing something. He's not alert to know if it was indeed just one of them or both, and if only one of them which one it was, but he knows if someone was up and about during the night. Each night. It might be a werewolf out looking for prey. It might be the helpful Seer who is trying to find werewolves. Or it might be any other number of nighttime active roles in the game.<br/><br/>Much more alert at nighttime is the Beholder. She wakes up the first night and sees who the Seer is! What she ends up doing with that information is anyone's guess, but hopefully she'll figure out how to help the village and prevent the Seer from being lynched by the crazed mob.<br/><br/>And then there's everyone's favorite numerically-aware goth, The Count. He's got his spreadsheet open, and he's, well, counting all night. He knows how many werewolves are on each side of him in the village because he counted. &quot;One Werewolf. Two, two scary hairy werewolves...ah ha ha ha. Three, three three evil lycanthropic werewolves...mwa ha ha ha.&quot;<br/><br/>Possibly the most mysterious creature of the night is the Thing (that goes &quot;bump&quot; in the night). This nasty, furry, slightly smelly creature is helping out the village by bumping people in the wee hours of night. What will those people do with the information garnered from the Thing? What is the Thing's ultimate purpose?<br/><br/>But not everyone is out to help people at nighttime. There's a new werewolf in town, though she's a little...sleepy. The Dreamwolf takes it easy, not bothering to wake up with the other werewolves unless one of her sister werewolves is killed. Then she's all about taking out her revenge on the village. Watch out!<br/><br/>Finally, the most feared night monster of all, the Bogeyman, rounds out the roles in Night Terrors. Take too long at nighttime and the Bogeyman gets to kill someone.

One player plays the Clowns: their goal is to abduct the remaining humans and force them into the Circus.  All the other players play Survivors, who roam the blasted wastes in a pitiful search for food, salvageable material, and safety... and who try to take out as many Clowns as possible along the way.<br/><br/>In Clownpocalypse, each player playing a human Survivor leads a Team.  At the start of the game your Team is just a single Survivor, but a big part of the game is rescuing other Survivors and attempting to lead them to safety. Each Survivor you shepherd to safety at game's end is worth a victory point, but having a large Team during the course of gameplay can create problems: the larger your Team, the more attention they attract from the Clowns.<br/><br/>It also gets tougher to feed them. In classic survival horror fashion, you start the game with only a limited number of Rations, and you'll need to use your quickly dwindling supply to feed each member of your Team every turn.  If your Team gets too large too fast, you're going to have trouble, and then you're going to need to do a hard moral calculus: do you let someone starve? Do you cannibalize your own Team? (Each of these choices has their own pros and cons.)<br/><br/>After you've fed your Team, you get the option to Travel. Traveling is the main way you move through the game deck, uncovering resources and, eventually, the Way Out.  There will always be three cards in the gameplay area displaying three possible resources to Travel to.  Those resources could be Locations, Rations, Salvage, Weapons, or other Survivors, and part of your strategic thinking in the game will involve assessing which resources your Team really needs--you can only attempt to get one per turn, leaving the rest on the table for your rivals.<br/><br/>And of course, there's danger.  The Clowns want to stop you from reaching those resources. So, each turn, the player playing the Clowns places one Clown card, face down, in front of each resource on the table.  This is where the game becomes a battle of wits.  The Clowns have some cards that are stronger than others, and so they need to carefully choose where they place their best cards.  Which resource on the table is the most valuable to the player whose turn it is?  Is that the one that the Clowns should defend the strongest?  Or should they bluff, placing a weaker Clown there in the event that the player decides to grab up a lesser resource, in the hope of avoiding confrontation?  Being able to predict your opponent's strategic choices is an important part of this game.<br/><br/>Once you've declared what resource you're travelling to (or opted to stay put, which has its own risks), the Clowns flip the card they uses to defend that resource, and a confrontation ensues.<br/><br/>Clownpocalypse contains 64 cards (Clowns, Survivors, Weapons, Salvage, and Locations), a set of counters to represent Rations, plus some other goodies in an attractive, sturdy box.

All of whom are tied together by the code and honour amongst pirates.<br/>Both code and honour will be betrayed multiple times as the players plot and make mischief for and against each other. One adventure takes approximately one to two hours, including all preparations and planning, such as shuffling the cards, creating characters and making up the premise. The game is playable with just the cards, but you might find the game easier to follow if you use paper to make notes and count the crosses in the Davy Jones Counter. The game is all about having fun. Push your characters into complicated and fun situations. Curse like a scallywag. Cheat fate, act like a legend, and if the inevitable cold grave calls you - go with a bang.<br/><br/>Each player has a character. After creating the characters, you may use the cards and the adventure-o-matic to create a grand,<br/>challenging adventure. All scenes start from a plot twist. The twists might be positive, helpful, funny or they might come in the shape of a challenge. Players respond to challenges by using cards from their hand. A player may play as many cards of the same suit as he likes, but the sum of their values must be at least equal to the challenge card&rsquo;s value in order to beat the challenge. If the character is unable to resolve a challenge with the cards in hand, the situation might call for a betrayal. A challenge from another character&rsquo;s action can kill a character, if the challenge winning player calls for it. However, challenges between characters do not need to be deadly: a character might try to seduce another or steal his hat.<br/><br/>Pirates never betray each other, or the pirate code, Well... at least if it&rsquo;s not a matter of life and death ... Or if it&rsquo;s not about love ... Or if there is no gold in it ... Or&hellip; well, you get the picture. A player calls for a betrayal, and asks for a suit. Even if the characters cannot die directly from the challenges, there is a price for failure and betrayal. Sooner or later the cold arms of the grave will welcome all pirates of the sea. There should be 12 empty slots in each character sheet. These slots are used to keep score of the character&rsquo;s failures and betrayals. Each time the character fails a challenge, two X&rsquo;s are added to the counter.<br/>Each time the character betrays the others, one X is added to the counter.<br/><br/>And each time the character gets one or more X&rsquo;s - a card is drawn. If the value of the card is equal or less than the number of X&rsquo;s on the character sheet, the character&rsquo;s days are numbered and he is doomed.If a character already has 12 X&rsquo;s on the sheet, he is immediately doomed, when he gets the 13th mark.<br/>A doomed character will die in any of the next three scenes. Players should not feel too attached to a doomed character. He might look pale or even ghostly or see omens of his death for he knows that the day is his last.<br/><br/>When and how does the game end?<br/>The game should end if<br/>&bull; Adventure has reached its conclusion,<br/>&bull; You reach agreed time limit (Professional pirates recommend using 2 hour time limit)<br/>&bull; Players are too tired (of drinking Rum) to play on.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 3.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Jukka Sorsa", "Ville Takanen"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Pirates"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Hounds of the Sea", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 90, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 5.75, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.25, "numcomments": 1}, "110962": {"mechanics": ["Hand Management"], "usersrated": 35, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1125733.jpg", "wishing": 22, "owned": 121, "trading": 19, "id": 110962, "yearpublished": 2012, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 2, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1125733_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Black Tea Studios"], "families": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "description": "Overview<br/>Shadow Days is a new and exciting fantasy deckbuilding, combat, and survival game from Black Tea Studios.

This can be a good excuse to do diorama bases for your leaders if you are so inclined.<br/><br/>Clash of Empires even has a use for those casualty figures you never painted!<br/><br/>THE RULEBOOK<br/><br/>In the rulebook will be lists for the Early Imperial Romans and its enemies in the west &ndash; Ancient Germans, Ancient British, Caledonians and Dacians.<br/><br/>The first army list book will cover Early Achaemenid Persia to the death of Alexander.<br/><br/>Many army lists will be free to download from the web.

In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.<br/><br/>It's up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins.<br/><br/>You can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave.<br/><br/>Caverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources.

Three years later the Conflict Resolution Accords were ratified. Now when conflicts arise, the involved states or ideological groups can settle the dispute in a manner that mitigates widespread destruction.

They have a set amount of points that they can use to buy modules for the Mech.

Once the modules have been purchased, the Mech stats are adjusted to reflect the module choices and teh game can commence.<br/><br/>Game play is similar to RoboRally or Wings of War in that each player will select 6 Move/Maneuver actions for their Mech each turn. In this manner, a turn is played out in six rounds as the Mechs execute their programmed moves. Can you out-maneuver your opponent? Do you risk an all out frontal attack.

The heart of Quidnam is the deck of 64 insightful cards developed from fundamental principles of human existence using Set Theory.  Each card has lore and art to provide verbal and visual suggestions as to their meaning.  There are 4 suits of 16 cards.  These suits represent the 4 planes of existence - physical,  biological, cognitive, and social.  Each plane (suit) has 4 unique elements and a color; each card in the suit is composed of a combination of those four elements from zero to four.   The mix of elements is shown on each card.<br/><br/>Meditation.  To meditate, simply decide on a topic, shuffle the deck, deal some cards using a pattern or method to your liking, and study the result.  You can do this alone or with family and friends.  Some patterns for reading are shown in the action shots.  You can create your own patterns and methods.  The topic is up to you.<br/><br/>The Quidnam deck can be used to play the Groupthink game.  This party game is best played with at least 4 players; the more the better.  A question or issue is chosen at the beginning of play.  Play consists of one or more rounds.  For each round, one player serves as a judge.  The role of judge rotates from round to round.  Shuffle the deck and deal some cards using a pattern or method that the group likes.  All players look at these cards and develop a secret reading which they write down and give to the judge.  The judge picks the best reading and the winner gets a point.

Every round is composed of the following phases:<br/><br/><br/>     The creatures progress. The creatures already on the board progress towards the side of the board using a totally automatic way of moving. New creatures (1 to 3, depending on a dice roll) arrive on the board and start to progress too.<br/>     Preparation of the Action tiles.

The number of places available on the tiles depends on the number of players.<br/>     Choice of actions. Each druid team carries out 5 actions a round, represented by Action markers. Players, in the reverse order of their position on the score track, choose their actions one by one by setting their Action markers on the available places on the Action cards. Actions can be: moving the druids (they only move on the path surrounding the glade), setting a magical stone (a magical stone is set at the intersection of the magical beams emitted by two druids looking at the glade, this costs energy; the magical beams do not cross obstacles), capturing creature(s) (a druid may capture a creature in front of him with his magical beam; this costs energy but gives MP and sometimes special properties), progressing in knowledge tracks (to increase the capacity of moving, or to increase the influence at the druid council, for &shy;instance), preparing magical beverages (to increase knowledge but also to recover energy), moving a magical stone (it is possible to move a magical stone), acquiring Power cards (they give special powers, such as allowing the magical beam to pass through a wall), and influencing a creature (allows to move a creature).<br/>     Actions are performed. Actions are performed marker by marker, from left to right, starting with the major actions before doing the minor ones. If the same colour of marker is encountered a second time on the same action, this action is not carried out. The actions on the next Action tile are then carried out and so on, until all major or all minor actions have been performed. Then, the players come back to the stopped action to perform it. Druids must inform the council about all their actions. After they have set a stone, captured a creature, or prepared a magical beverage, druids are placed at the druid council. Any druid can start from the council to enter back the path, but he can also stay at the council to influence it and gain MP at the end of the round.<br/>     Activation of magical stones. At the end of each round, all stones that are aligned and of the same colour automatically become menhirs.

To set up each of the three cities in the game, draw five gangster cards at random, then place them in a row in numerical order (with a range of 1-80). Even and odd cards belong to different gangs and are color-coded. Each player has a hand of four gangster cards and a random special action card.<br/><br/>On a turn, each player chooses one gangster and one city card/one special card, then they reveal them simultaneously. Players place cards in ascending order from lowest to highest. If a gangster was played with a city card, it's placed in that city in the proper numerical spot; if it was played with a special card, it can be placed in any city, with the special card being placed in the same city before or after the gangster. If the card you placed is one of two gangsters surrounding at least two gangsters of the other color, then you capture the surrounded gangsters and remove them from play.

Instead of cards, dice give you the beans that you must use to satisfy orders and (eventually) collect &quot;Bohnentalers&quot; (i.e., dollars, bucks, dinero...). The first player to collect thirteen Bohnentalers wins.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player receives two order cards, each of which shows six orders; the player tries to complete orders on one card while using the other to cover completed orders. The easiest orders to complete &ndash; say, two specific bean types or three beans in any combination of two types &ndash; are at the bottom of the card, and the hardest ones &ndash; requiring, say, a four-of-a-kind or seven beans with no blue ones &ndash; are at the top. Orders must be completed from bottom to top.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player starts by rolling the seven bean dice, three of which have one combination of beans and four of which have another combination. This player must set aside at least one bean, then she rerolls any remaining dice, setting at least one aside, etc. After at most seven rolls, she completes as many orders as she can, reusing the dice as needed to complete orders. Once a player completes three orders, she can &quot;harvest&quot; the card for one coin. Each additional completed order is worth a coin, up to a maximum of four. When a player harvests the order card, she draws a new card and uses that to record completed orders (possibly on the same turn) on the order card she already had.<br/><br/>In the Bohnanza card game, players trade cards to improve the standing of both parties involved in the trade. In W&uuml;rfel Bohnanza, the active player doesn't trade dice, but opponents do get to benefit from that player's rolls. After each roll by the active player, all other players can use the dice just rolled &ndash; and not dice already set aside &ndash; to complete orders on their own cards. Thus, the active player has some incentive not to dawdle too much with her rolls as her opponents might benefit from her turn more than she does.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as one or more players have collected thirteen Bohnentalers.

They can be bought and sold at the gem exchange, shady traders are always willing to engage in a little wheeling and dealing, and then you can use the gems to claim valuable mining rights, artifacts and jewellery. Who will become the most successful gem trading mogul?<br/><br/>Zavandor is a fantasy setting which revolves around a capitalist economy based on trading in gems - sapphires, rubies, mystical gems etc. Other games in the family include Mines of Zavandor, and The Scepter of Zavandor.<br/><br/>Gnomes of Zavandor features two central boards. The first is a grid with markers indicating the current price of each of the gem types, and also indicating whether the price is going to go up or down next turn. Gems can be bought (or sold) for cash in the first phase of each turn. Buying gems makes them more valuable in subsequent turns; selling them reduces their value, and this is reflected on the grid. These gems can be used to buy tiles from the second board, a star-shaped arena featuring &quot;mining rights&quot; tiles positioned randomly around it. The position on the board indicates the cost to purchase these mining rights; the cost will be a mixed selection of coloured gems. At the end of each turn, players gain new gems according to the mining rights they have acquired and this affects the central economy, generally reducing the value of the relevant gems when they are purchased for hard cash, in future rounds.<br/><br/>The initial phase of the turn involves buying gems, selling gems, taking gold, trading with the central supply, and purchasing cards and tokens (with gems rather than cash). The items available for purchase include equipment improving your efficiency, jewels providing victory points, and mining rights. The second phase of the turn involves mining for new gems. Each player takes the gems they are allowed according to their mining rights. At the end of each turn, the market values are adjusted according to the actions which have occurred; the price of the available equipment is discounted (this rule is optional); and another area of the star-shaped board becomes accessible with more mining-rights available to purchase in the next round.<br/><br/>The game continues until one player has reached a victory-point target, dependent on the number of players in the game.

In actual harness racing there are various sources where you can gather the information that is needed to create a Past Performance Chart for actual horses &amp; drivers.  So based on the Past Performance chart you decided how much risk that you can take and place wagers on the race.  The movement of the horses is based on the Past Performance chart data with probabilities of different outcomes based on a history of actual races.  These probabilities are realized in the game thru movement cards and a spinner.  The movement mechanism does not take into account all of the information that is recommended to be collected for making bets at the track.  However, to take everything into account would make for an overly analytical game and would present the false concept that predicting races is just a matter of math.  The game instructions explain all of the common terms and concepts that are considered important when deciding what bets to place.  And it presents a logical method for recording important information needed to place bets.  If you ignore the educational aspects of the game it is a fun game.  The pawns movement mechanism is similar to the more well known Win Place &amp; Show.  In each round the rigs have a movement for the round and then two of the pawns receive bonus movement.  The races in this game are much shorter than most other race games, about 4 rounds.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": [], "categories": ["Racing", "Sports"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Handicap Harness Racing", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 45, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "103017": {"mechanics": ["Partnerships", "Point to Point Movement", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "usersrated": 5, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1043639.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 15, "trading": 0, "id": 103017, "yearpublished": 1997, "maxplayers": 12, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1043639_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Tactic"], "families": ["Alias"], "description": "This is the first expansion to a popular word explanation game called alias.<br/>In this expansion you get 200 new cards from to explain the words.<br/><br/>These cards only go with the FIRST edition of Alias.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 4, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Mikko Koivusalo"], "categories": ["Deduction", "Expansion for Base-game", "Party Game", "Word Game"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Alias: New Cards", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 45, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 6.2, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.748331, "numcomments": 1}, "111210": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1382392.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 3, "trading": 0, "id": 111210, "yearpublished": 2011, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1382392_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Green Board Game Co."], "families": [], "description": "Wummy! is a word game that is family friendly as well as possibly educational.

Players take the sides of France or its opponents, a coalition of Allies. In its long form the game opens with Napoleon&rsquo;s arrival at Paris following his return from Elba. It encompasses his efforts to restore France to a war footing, the Allies&rsquo; struggle to revive their anti-French coalition, and the military operations that ensue. BEYOND WATERLOO is played on a mapboard that includes France plus relevant portions of the Low Countries, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. Where most games on this period focus in on the famous Battle of Waterloo, BEYOND WATERLOO takes in the full scope of the politico-military possibilities inherent in the 1815 situation. The Allies must re-defeat Napoleon. The French must avoid that outcome.<br/><br/>BEYOND WATERLOO is a full strategic simulation encompassing military, economic, and diplomatic developments. It also introduces new design concepts for a game of this nature. Because of the complexities involved, these rules adopt a layered approach. Initially, the Combat Game introduces only the Battle Development Sequence, which affords a way to conduct combat in a strategic game that is nuanced for the Napoleonic era. This level of rules enables the player to learn the combat system using a scenario that covers only the Battle of Waterloo itself. At the next level, the Basic Game, rules introduce the full movement and administrative systems for a Napoleonic campaign. The scenario replicates the military action, economic factors, and force mobilization in this last Napoleonic War. The Advanced Game adds diplomacy, strategy and political action, and emphasizes the mobilization for war. In this long-form the game begins with Napoleon&rsquo;s return to Paris and the sides must prepare for war before conducting it.<br/><br/>BEYOND WATERLOO is played on a mapboard subdivided into areas that regulate the movement of game forces. Pieces represent prominent Commanders on all sides, and armies, corps, and divisions. Players organize and move their pieces across the mapboard to further their strategy. The players accumulate Resource Points (RPs) and Victory Points (VPs) as the game progresses. RPs procure fresh forces. The VPs influence events in the Campaign of 1815 as well as determining the winner of the game.

If the order comes from a flagship, she can order 2 different ship-cards (including his own), if there is at least one ship of that card near.<br/><br/>The ordered cards get rotated a bit to show it has been activated and cannot be ordered again the next turn (so if there are 2 commanders and one requests for the carrier to act, you cannot order it the next turn but could only &quot;reset&quot; it to active status).<br/><br/>Order cards could also used to activate special abilities on ships (and special equipments) and also have a secondary &quot;effect&quot; and could be discarded to get that effect.<br/>In this way, there are always crucial decisions during the game, like: will I discard a card now to get that missile barrage on my enemy and support the other commander attack, or I will keep it to have more options the next turn.<br/><br/>The game almost never falls in a &quot;cannot order anything&quot; scenario, and a commander can expect to order the units he needs most of the time. But if he spens a great deal of cards to support his attacks, his decision could be limited in the next turns, while he builds back his &quot;hand&quot; of cards.<br/><br/>The firing is very simple, based on normal six sided dices rolls. Very rarely one roll is fundamental, since u can always maneuver and use skills to get the best rolling options for your attack.<br/><br/>The game has several scenarios already, and more races and scenarios are being developed/tested while we WAIT FOR AN EDITOR (the game is not yet published, just my homemade copy for now and some playtesting copies around).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Giorgio De Michele"], "categories": ["Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Space Commander", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 90, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.25, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 3.63146, "numcomments": 0}, "103051": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1056924.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 103051, "yearpublished": 1900, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1056924_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Partridge and Oakey"], "families": [], "description": "23 cards.

Do you rely on sheer fishing talent, or do you break out the Banjooki 2000 Platinum-plated Turbo Reel to haul in the monster fish? The choice is yours!<br/><br/>Take the Bait plays up to four players, and features a game board laid out like a lake with the game sections arranged around the lake in a semi-circle. The players take on the roles of four fishing teams at a tournament, lead by some whimsical characters with special abilities from which the players can choose.<br/><br/>The game is divided into three days (rounds), with three turns each round. Players begin the first, third and sixth turns at camp, in tents. They visit the campground canteen and, depending on certain circumstances, choose a coffee for the day, which will determine their turn order. Of course, the coffee that gives the biggest kick allows a player to go first but it also costs the most. Then it's onto the tackle shop to buy some equipment - some items are mundane, but cheap, while others are a bit more special but may require players to spend more cash, which isn't easy to come by.<br/><br/>Next, it's time for fishing. According to certain character powers, equipment mixes, etc. the players take turns drawing fish (tiles) out of three areas of the lake. The area closest to shore is the easiest to fish in, but it's where all the smaller fish dwell. The middle body of the lake has some bigger fish but requires a pier license to reach. The third is the deepest and most costly in which to fish, but it's where the big daddies live, including one monster catfish that has never been caught and has fueled tall tales for years at the lake. Mixed into the tiles in each of the sections are also various bits of detritus such as old boots, lost bikinis and such that always seem to latch onto hooks during any fishing trip. They'll hurt your score at the end of the tournament, but some may very well be of use to someone if they, or an opponent, have a matching item...<br/><br/>Then there's the market, where fish can be sold for money to buy bigger equipment, or held until the end of the current day (round). The market prices fluctuate from day to day and there's a catch of the day that brings a bonus, so players will have to decide whether that fish is best kept for score or sold for cash.<br/><br/>The final station for each turn is the lodge where teams can hire a guide - an extra hand that will help them fish for the day. The guides get cheaper as the tournament draws to an end, so players will need to decide whether they pay a premium for that extra help in the beginning or save their money for one last push at the end. Teams can also check the weather for the next day while at the lodge, giving them a little insight at the weather patterns that could influence fish migration.<br/><br/>The next turns continue until the end of the day when there is a weigh in, which scores points for players. The player who has the most points at the end of three days wins!<br/><br/>Teams can also freely trade among themselves. This trading keeps the game lively and social, as players tempt each other to &quot;take the bait.&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Cherilyn Joy Lee Kirkman", "Christopher Kirkman"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Animals", "Negotiation", "Sports"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Take the Bait", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 6.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.0, "numcomments": 4}, "103079": {"mechanics": ["Memory", "Pattern Recognition", "Route/Network Building"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1332124.jpg", "wishing": 4, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 103079, "yearpublished": 2012, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1332124_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Greater Than Games (Dice Hate Me Games)"], "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "description": "The heat is on!

Placing a card in the third stage stack forces the player to swap the position of that stack with the first or second stack.<br/><br/>The race is timed - three minutes for each heat.

LTD."], "families": [], "description": "Developed by a real-life fur trapping couple, Fur Out was marketed as Canada's first &quot;family wildlife game.&quot;<br/><br/>The game, not just a simple roll and move affair, features three different types of characters (Trappers, the Game Warden, &amp; the Anti-Trapper). Trappers set traps and score points by catching &amp; selling furs. As they accumulate wealth, trappers can buy and build cabins on the board to set trap-lines to make even more money. Trappers can also tamper with each others traps and even steal them. However, if the Game Warden (only one allowed per game) catches them they can end up in jail. The Game Warden is also a trapper, so he can cash in on any poached game he seizes, as well as set traps himself. (However, as a lawman the Game Warden can't tamper with other player's traps.) The Anti-Trapper (only one allowed per game) scores by stealing traps from the Trappers and generally making life miserable for them.<br/><br/>Players navigate the unusual snowshoe-shaped board by rolling 2 six-sided dice and traveling along the showshoe's webbing. Different spots on the board allow players to set up traps for various game animals. (These spots are always on the edges of diamond or hexagonal areas that frame the illustration of the animal to be trapped.) Some animal hides are virtually worthless (like the lowly Skunk) while others pay top dollar (like the mighty Grizzly Bear). Only one trap may be set per square. A player must return to the square by landing on it with an exact die roll to successfully make a catch. Unfortunately, other players that land on the square may &quot;steal&quot; a catch from the trap. However, the offending player may be sent to jail for poaching if the Game Warden lands on the spot while they're still there.<br/><br/>Initially trappers are restricted to the first level of the board, but when they successfully trap an animal, they may progress another level down the board, repeating the process as they bag bigger and better game. Cards from the Fur In deck (collected when traps catch animals) make movement, and therefore scoring, more predictable. Cards from the Fur Out deck (collected when larger traps catch bigger animals) allow players to slowly collect letters to spell out the names of the animals with the biggest ticket furs... and to eventually make top dollar. A deck of event cards, name Yellowhead Cards (after the nickname of a famous Iroquois trapper/trader named Pierre Bostonais) can significantly alter a player's turn. This deck is activated by landing on particular spaces spread around the board. (Interestingly, the Anti-Trapper player is instructed to interpret the Yellowhead Cards to the best of his ability from his perspective. Some Yellowhead Cards simply won't apply to the Anti-Trapper.)<br/><br/>Players are allowed to trade or sell any in-game items to each other. This even applies to things like players combining Fur Out cards so that they can divide up a big score.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, players can buy Cabins to effectively take over certain game spaces for themselves. However this becomes an attractive target for the Anti-Trapper who'll want to burn the cabin down (as long as he can stay out of reach of the Game Warden).<br/><br/>The game may be played to a time limit (Trapping Season) or to any other method of conclusion that they players can agree on.

It also exist in a tabletop version aimed at dinner parties. On its surface, Sixteen Tons looks like a large-scale boardgame, in which players move very heavy pieces around a four-by-four grid, trying to maneuver their pieces into a winning position. The winniong position is pre the player to get her/his two game pieces orthogonally adjacent. This core gameplay is complicated by the fact that players can pay each other with real money. At the start of the game, each player takes out three one-dollar bills and this money is used to pay other players to move your pieces for you. Playing the game becomes an experience that critically blurs work and play, as the real value of money is grafted onto the artificial meanings of the game, and player identitiy shifts fluidly back and forth from cooperation to competition. Winning the game requires both strategic thinking and social smarts and the rules are intentionally ambiguous about whether players keep each others&rsquo; money after a game. Sixteen Tons is named after the folk song made famous in 1955 by Tennessee Ernie Ford about coal mining and debt bondage.<br/><br/>In Sixteen Tons, four players play a strategy game using heavy sections of steel pipe as the pieces of the game. At the beginning of the game, players take out three dollar bills from their wallets. This money is used to pay other players to move your pieces for you during the game. The play of Sixteen Tons combines strategic with social thinking. The strategy game is simple to solve &ndash; but the socal game is impossible to predict.<br/><br/>The rules are ambiguous about what to do with the money in hand at the end of the game.

Each player plays as one of ten heroes, against one of four villains, and the battle takes place in one of four different dynamic environments.<br/><br/>Each player, after selecting one of the heroes, plays a deck of 40 cards against the villain and environment decks, which &quot;play themselves&quot;, requiring the players to put the top card of the appropriate deck into play on the villain and environment turns. On each player's turn, they may play a card from their hand, use a power printed on one of their cards in play, and draw a card from their deck. Each round starts with the villain turn, continues clockwise around the table, then concludes with the environment turn. Each villain has various advantages, such as starting with certain cards in play, as specified by the villain character card. Play continues until the heroes reduce the villain to 0 or fewer HP, or until the villain defeats the heroes, either via a win condition or by reducing all the heroes to 0 or fewer HP.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 2.4992, "bayesaverage": 7.16281, "designers": ["Christopher Badell", "Paul Bender", "Adam Rebottaro"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Comic Book / Strip", "Fighting"], "name": "Sentinelas do Multiverso", "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "208"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "64"}], "average": 7.36799, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.64127, "numcomments": 2507}, "111314": {"mechanics": ["Co-operative Play", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1129143.png", "wishing": 0, "owned": 3, "trading": 1, "id": 111314, "yearpublished": 1996, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1129143_t.png", "publishers": ["Herder Spiele"], "families": ["Animals: Bears", "Animals: Bees"], "description": "Objective: Try to protect (as a bee) your honey - cooperative game<br/>Players are using 2 colour-dice &amp; moving by turns<br/>One die should be assigned to the bear, the other to the active bee/player<br/><br/>Big bear is watching bees and finds out, that honey is produced by these small animals. <br/>If the bees will support each other they have a chance to protect their honey against the bear<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Bernhard Flore", "Gertrud Flore"], "categories": ["Animals", "Children's Game"], "name": "Bzzz!

It is also a good idea for all players to have miniatures that are similar in scale.<br/><br/>2. CREATION POINTS<br/><br/>Before you can create your gang all players must decide on how many creation points will be used for gang construction. An average gang costs 200 creation points.<br/><br/>3.

It has been inspired by the old kingdoms surrounding the Great Zimbabwe, a world heritage site in southern Africa. Far into the previous century, colonial governments denied that a civilization that produced such impressive monuments and beautiful artwork could have been African in origin. But of course, this civilization was African, and the country of Zimbabwe itself was proudly named after this impressive cultural heritage. As always in our games, we have used this history for inspiration; however, first and foremost we wanted to create a highly playable and replayable Splotter game, so in many cases we took liberties with historical names, periods and artwork.<br/><br/>In the game, players strive to build the most impressive monuments to one god of their choice. They can choose this god themselves-- each of the twelve gods offers a unique blessing, but each also requires a different amount of work to win the game. Building the monuments is done by developing a logistics network stretching across the region. Through this network, players produce and obtain ritual goods to raise their monuments and bring honour to the god of their choice.<br/><br/>Here's the flavour text from the rules:<br/><br/>The Mutapa king struts into the village, followed by a bunch of young warriors herding cattle. &ldquo;Oondabezitha &rdquo;, he addresses the assembly of kings, &ldquo;I have brought twelve heads of cattle for the ceremony tonight&rdquo;. The others seem to shrink in stature as he speaks. The star of the king of Mutapa is clearly ascending. They have not brought nearly as much cattle themselves. &ldquo;Soon, we will all be praying to Obatala&rdquo;, murmurs one of the older Kilwa traders. &ldquo;The Mutapa will be raising their godless monuments sky-high. Perhaps it is time for us to resort to some magic of our own&rdquo;. Then the sky breaks into a thunder and a torrential rain pours down on the assembly. The men scramble while the plains fill with water. The ceremony will be wet tonight...<br/><br/><br/>The Great Zimbabwe is a logistico-economic game in which players are tribal leaders in Africa trying to please the gods by building monuments.<br/><br/>Buying technology, building craftsmen, gathering resources and worshipping a god are among the many decisions necessary to win in 'The Great Zimbabwe'. But the main way of getting there is building and developing a network of monuments. The higher the monuments, the closer the players will be to victory, but players must balance many subtle aspects of the game.

Each round consists of the players' turns and an End Phase in which the board is adjusted to prepare for the next round. Each player begins with 10 points of dinosaurs on the board, and increases this point total in two ways: (1) by successfully breeding dinosaurs to produce eggs, which hatch into new dinosaurs at the end of the round; (2) by introducing a new species during the End Phase.<br/>During a turn, a player rolls dice to determine the locations of new plant growth on the board, migrates dinosaurs to new locations, and attempts to feed and breed dinosaurs.  For predators, feeding involves hunting other dinosaurs.  Other players become involved with the current player's turn when their dinosaurs are hunted, and they must choose to fight or flee, and when they choose to play a card that impacts the current player's actions.<br/>During the End Phase, fresh kills become rotten carcasses, rotten carcasses rot away entirely, hungry dinosaurs starve, eggs hatch, and players have an opportunity to choose one of four improvements for the following round (various combinations of new dinosaurs, eggs, and cards).<br/><br/>Goal: The game ends when at least one player has reached 40 points at the end of a round.

Categories:  Players have to list things that belong in a specific category, such as listing five fruits that have one large pit in the middle.<br/><br/>2.  Forward and Back:  Players have to recite things forward and/or backwards, such as reciting the alphabet forwards and backwards from A to F.<br/><br/>3.  Problem Solving:  The game comes with various cut out shapes and cut out words.  Using shapes, the players have to create a specific design, like a triangle similar to the pattern on the card, using the shapes provided.  Using words the players have to create a sentence, like a sentence in which someone throws something to someone else.<br/><br/>A player can elect to perform the task without distraction and win one token or with distraction and win two tokens.

There are three decks of Task cards with varied levels of difficulty: easier, regular, and challenge.

All children have been involved in bullying incidents, whether as a target, a bully, or a bystander.  Players learn that everyone can play an important role in reducing bullying.  The target of the bullying will become the victim if he/she cannot stop the bullying attempt.  In addition, the bystander who laughs when the bully makes fun of another student is unwittingly rewarding the bully with the status he/she seeks and encouraging more bullying.<br/><br/>Like other behavior, bullying behavior is not random, rather it is motivated by specific goals.  Most bullying is motivated by social goals, such as status, popularity, power, having fun, etc.  The game emphasizes that all students in the school community have the ability to support bullying or to discourage it.  Students learn concrete, non-violent skills to use in bullying situations.  In addition to the game's systems approach, it differs from most other approaches to bullying in two important respects.  First, it pays attention to the potentially positive role of the bystanders.  Second, it gives bullies positive skills to use to achieve their goals without resorting to bullying behavior.<br/><br/>The game box includes rules for both cooperative play and competitive play.  In each version players read Situation cards that describe typical middle school bullying behavior.

The first one being, &ldquo;Who killed Cock Robin?&rdquo; And the last one being, &ldquo;Who will sing the psalm?&rdquo;<br/>The old card game offers a twist at the ending and differs from the nursery rhyme. The players of the game are told Cock Robin is alive and well and they have all been telling a story! This is the part of the game which truly has the players interacting with each other and reveals the fun age of the times.<br/>The directions for the game of Cock Robin begin with choosing a person to be the dealer. After having all the cards dealt out to theplayers, the dealer is then the person who asks the questions.  For example, the dealer reads the first question of &ldquo;Who killed Cock Robin?&rdquo; The correct animal card to specifically answer is the Sparrow card. It reads, &ldquo;I, said the Sparrow, with my bow and arrow. I killed Cock Robin.&rdquo; If the player has the &lsquo;Sparrow&rsquo; card, he lays his card down on the table in front of him and the dealer asks the next question to the next player (Who saw him die?).<br/>If the player does not have the sparrow card in his hand, he picks a card from the player to his left and reads a generic answer card (often humorous) before laying that card on the table in a separate pile. The dealer proceeds to ask the next player the same question until the correct answer card is found and played. The player who answers the question will take any of the generic cards played to the question and place them (if there are any) in his hand<br/><br/>Once all the questions have been read and answered the exciting part of the game begins! The dealer reads the following script,<br/>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Bullfinch, Oh, Mr. Popinjay <br/>Never believe what these little birds say-<br/>Bad little birds&mdash;telling us a story-<br/>Cock Robin is alive in all his glory!&rdquo;<br/>The dealer continues to read the next line of,<br/>&ldquo;Cock Robin is all alive&mdash;Mr. Sparrow, pay a fine for that story now, about your bow and arrow.&rdquo;<br/><br/><br/>The player who has the Cock Robin Sparrow Card in front of him must then &lsquo;pay the fine&rsquo;. The fine is anything the dealer wants it to be. In the directions, suggestions for the fine are, &ldquo;to kiss the one loved best (which is often the looking glass), or to flatter some of the other company&hellip;&rdquo;<br/>Additional scripts are read for each of the animals and the players with these cards in front of them must do what it says. Other examples are as follows:<br/>  Cock Robin is all alive&mdash;Miss Lark, Shut your eyes and sing us a song in the dark. <br/>  To pay for the story you told&mdash;Mr. Linnet, tell us where your night cap is, and how you get in it. <br/>  Your manners are very bad, Mr. Rook, in all your reading what was your dullest book?<br/> The last script read reveals the winner of the game of Cock Robin. It reads, &ldquo;And now Mr. Thrush, Come out of your bush, and sing us a song.

This is leading to shortages of water in some regions and to very difficult life conditions.<br/><br/>In this game, players can influence the water cycle. The board represents the water cycle, with all the elements described above, each of them is numbered (from 1 to 6). Players throw dices and each of them choose a movement (one dice) that they want to do. Then they will have to move their water (colour cubes for each player) between those elements. The board also has the population, that is increasing at the same time it&rsquo;s fed with water, and players will try to ensure the population gets the water that it needs. Only this way can they get points.

It is one map, with 60 or so combat units (both players) in action at any given time.  This allows for a pace of play not possible with the previously published OCS monster games. Regardless of the reduction in scale it remains an OCS game with all features relevant to the system.  In this game there can be wide open, swirling, DAK-like battles in the desert (with some: limited armor forces), river lines to break, and very rough, mountainous terrain to contend with. The British have the possibility of an amphibious invasion.  Naval shore bombardments, by both sides, can be important in the early part of the campaign. There is a small but significant air campaign.  As always in the OCS, supply constraints make each player feel he may be on the edge of disaster.<br/><br/>This campaign remains a footnote in WWII history even among many knowledgeable enthusiasts.  However, given the nature of events in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations during the first half of 1941, this campaign was arguably the hot spot in the world at that moment in time.[...]<br/><br/>The Vichy were well equipped and organized. They put up stiff opposition, and counterattacked with great effect. The Commonwealth and Free French forces, at first, were stopped cold. Ironically, it was the failure of Operation Battleaxe (June 15) in the Western desert that allowed reinforcements for this campaign from the Western Desert and a resumption of the Commonwealth offensive. After Damascus fell, Beirut was seriously threatened and with Indian 10th division troops (along with Habforce) moving on Aleppo and Homs to the North, the Vichy proposed an armistice to end the fighting.<br/><br/>The armistice was signed on July 14.

Based on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones is an epic board game in which it will take more than military might to win. Will you take power through force, use honeyed words to coerce your way onto the throne, or rally the townsfolk to your side? Through strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, spread your influence over Westeros!<br/><br/>To begin the game, each player receives an army of Footman, Knight, Siege Engine, and Ship units, as well as a set of Order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique House Cards, which are used as leaders in battles against rival Houses.<br/><br/>Each round in the game is made up of three phases: the Westeros Phase, the Planning Phase, and the Action Phase. The Westeros Phase represents special events and day-to-day activities in Westeros. There are three different Westeros Decks, and each denotes a different global action, potentially affecting all players.<br/><br/>The Planning Phase is perhaps the most important. Here you secretly assign orders to all of your units by placing one order token face down on each area you control that contains at least one unit (Knight, Footman, Ship, or Siege Engine). This portion of the game emphasizes diplomacy and deduction. Can you trust the alliance that you made? Will you betray your ally and march upon him? Players may make promises to each other (for aid or peace, for example), but these promises are never binding. The result is tense and compelling negotiations, often ending in backstabbing worthy of Westeros!<br/><br/>During the Action Phase, the orders are resolved and battle is entered! When armies meet in combat, they secretly choose one of their House cards to add strength to the battle. Finally, the Houses can consolidate their power in the areas they control and use that power in future turns to influence their position in the court of the Iron Throne and to stand against the wildling Hordes.<br/><br/>In addition to featuring updated graphics and a clarified ruleset, this second edition of A Game of Thrones includes elements from the A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations like player screens and Tides of Battle cards.<br/><br/>Tides of Battle cards are an optional mechanism that brings an element of unpredictability to combat, representing erratic shifts in the momentum of war due to factors such as weather, morale, and tactical opportunity. During each combat, both players draw one Tides of Battle card from a communal deck, and its value modifies the strength of his chosen House card. What's more, such a card may also contain icons that can affect the outcome of the battle...all of which delivers a new level of intensity to your military engagements.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u2013 A Dance with Dragons (2012)<br/>     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u2013 A Feast for Crows (2013)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/>     A Game of Thrones (first edition) (2003)<br/>     A Game of Thrones: A Clash of Kings Expansion (2004)<br/>     A Game of Thrones: A Storm of Swords Expansion (2006)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 3.6354, "bayesaverage": 7.55167, "designers": ["Christian T.

Epigo is also modular - the boxed game includes rules for 21 variants, with more variants available on our website.  Variants modify one or more of the core rules, providing unique challenges and adding countless hours of replayability.<br/><br/>The Rules<br/><br/>To win, be the first to capture three of your opponents&rsquo; Epigons by pushing them off the edge of the board.  Epigons have a rank between 1 and 7 dictating the speed at which they move.  At the start of every round, both players choose and stack three Orders from their hand. The top Order of a stack marks the first move, the middle tile is the second move, and the third tile is the last move.  Each Order has arrows on one side, indicating the direction the corresponding Epigon will try to move.  Once both players have locked in their moves, the stacks are revealed and unraveled.  First, compare the top Order on each stack.  The higher ranking Epigon moves one space in the direction shown on the arrows.  Then the other Epigon (matching the lower priority Order) moves in the same manner.  If both players reveal Orders of the same rank they cancel and neither Epigon moves (players often try to make this happen intentionally for various nefarious purposes). After three moves, players pick up all of their Orders and start the next round.<br/><br/>When moving an Epigon, one of three things will happen: it will Slide, Push, or be Blocked.  When an Epigon moves into an empty space, it Slides into it. If that space is occupied however, the Epigon tries to Push in that direction instead.  An Epigon must have a majority of friendly pieces moving in the same direction whenever it tries to Push otherwise the move is Blocked.  The full rulebook contains detailed explanations of the movement rules, and is available on our website.<br/><br/>The boxed game accomodates up to 4 players in teams of 2, and introduces variant play.

When players breed horses, they breed their mare to other players' stallions, and each player can set a stud fee for how much this costs.

Only time will tell.<br/><br/>Inspired by classic games such as Parcheesi/Ludo and Checkers/Draughts, Accolade is an abstract game of chance and strategy, which has players maneuver their Squires around the exterior path of the board in an attempt to reach their home cathedral (similar to Parcheesi).

This new Knight now reenters the board, now with the sole goal of interfering with your opponent's Squires and Knights.<br/><br/>The board is made up of a central hub and 4 spokes, which are assembled differently depending on the number of players (2-4), allowing for a scalable game that decreases the amount of dead time experienced in a 2 player game of Parcheesi/Ludo.  Though the board could also be used as an alternate Parcheesi board using those standard rules (and there is a bonus draughts board on the back of the main hub as well).<br/><br/>The main mechanic of the game is simple dice rolling for movement in a similar style to Parcheesi, but the pieces have more options on what they can do with those rolls.  Opposing pawns (Squires/Knights) interact with each other by Checking (landing on them, as in Parcheesi) or Capturing (jumping over, as in Checkers) them.  Pawns can attain a degree of safety by being in Castle spaces, or forming a Castle by doubling up 2 pawns of the same color.<br/><br/>Points (influence) are scored for removing opposing Squire / Knights and for any of your own Knights on the board (not in your home area).<br/><br/>The game ends once all remaining pawns are Knights, then the player with the most points (influence) gains the ear of the King and is considered the winner.<br/><br/>The game was created as an entry for TGC Classic Game Mashup Contest.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Val Cassotta"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Accolade: Journey to Knighthood", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "111634": {"mechanics": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1135582.png", "wishing": 0, "owned": 2, "trading": 0, "id": 111634, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1135582_t.png", "publishers": ["Espenlaub"], "families": ["Animals: Cats", "Animals: Mice"], "description": "Objective: Try to protect all your mice - put them into a safe hideout.<br/>'Kater Kralle' (cat Claw) is busy with hunting mice and tries to imprison them.

But due to suspicions about vaccines and links to other diseases, more parents are refusing to immunize their children, and this could lead to a national health crisis.

As a wildcard, substituting for one of the required dice values desired at any time during the 3 rolls. If you use a wildcard you must give the marker to the other player who then places it on their Transport Track on the space matching the wildcard value (ex. Player 1 uses a wildcard marker sitting on their airplane (6) transport type. They give this marker to Player 2 who then places it on their (6) space. If the transportation space is occupied that player may place it on another transportation type of their choice.<br/>2. As a blocker, placing the marker on any space along any shipment path as long as it matches the color of the transportation type on the shipment path.

It is 400AD and Britain is on the brink of a power vacuum as Rome looks to leave these shores and defend her empire closer to home. Foreign invaders, like the Picts, Scots, Vikings and Saxons, will take advantage and claim this land for their own. Romano-British rule is coming to and end and we are at the dawn of the Anglo-Saxon era. You must defend the Anglo-Saxon heptarchy from these foreign invaders and quash the rebellious Britons. But history is written and there is an ever looming threat. In 1066, William Duke of Normandy became king of all England and ended the Anglo-Saxon era once and for all. Can you make this land your own before the Norman invasion?<br/><br/>Seofan, the Anglo-Saxons board game, is a game for 1 to 4 players. You progress through the game from 400AD to 1066AD. Your Bretwalda will travel the seven kingdoms of England along roads like the great Fosse Way, Ermine Street and Watling Street, seeking to control towns by building forts (to exercise your military might), monasteries (to convert the pagan settlers), mints (a source of wealth), and burhs (Anglo-Saxon settlements of power). You will use warriors, missionaries, farmers and traders to settle and defend the kingdoms, and resource cards to fund your settlement, your armies, your church and your economy. Each turn your Bretwalda can take actions to travel the seven kingdoms, to enact great battles, to convert pagan settlers, to trade, and to build your realm.<br/><br/>Game events will be throwing unexpected surprises at you as you proceed through each decade, like the legend of Arthur, the writings of the Venerable Bede, the Viking invasions, the revolutionary laws of Aethelberht, Offa and Ine, or the glorious coronation of King Alfred the Great. These events may be your saviour, or they may signal your downfall. All the while, rebellious uprisings can cause the level of civil unrest to rise. Can you conquer and control the seven kingdoms before the level of civil unrest explodes, and rewrite history by building a permanent Anglo-Saxon England before the Norman invasion of 1066?<br/><br/>Overview of Gameplay<br/><br/>The game can be played solo or co-operatively, with 1 to 4 players.<br/><br/>The game board shows a map of the seven kingdoms of England (Northumbria, Mercia, East Anglia, Essex, Sussex, Kent and Wessex), and the towns of those kingdoms in which you will settle, battle, trade and rule. These towns are linked by roads along which the players (and invaders!) can travel.<br/><br/>Each game turn is broken into distinct phases. In the Draw phase you draw resource cards from a resource deck into your hand. In the Actions phase each player has 4 actions which they can use in a variety of ways: they can spend resource cards to place red, green, yellow and blue blocks (representing warriors, farmers, missionaries and traders) across the towns of the seven kingdoms; they can build mints, forts, monasteries and burhs; they can travel the map from town to town, repelling invaders and rebels (represented by black blocks); they can trade or crusade or appease local unrest, and progress through the game by adding a decade to the game calendar. During the Conflict phase you resolve battles between your warriors and the pagans. During the Rebellion phase you draw cards from a rebellion deck, which determines in which towns the locals are rebelling against your rule (and more black blocks appear). Finally, in the Progress phase, you can advance the game time through the seven eras from 400AD to 1066AD, and an event card is drawn to re-enact real events from history on the game board. You can choose to progress more slowly, giving you more time to build and settle and defend the realm, but when you do the level of civil unrest will rise too. As you progress through the game you progress through time, and real events from history will throw up surprises - some good (like a great coronation feast), and some bad (like a mutinous group of mercenaries).<br/><br/>To win the game you must control all seven kingdoms. To control a kingdom you must repel, defeat, convert or settle all black blocks in the kingdom and build one of each type of special building (fort, monastery, mint, and burh). This allows you to place a celtic cross in the kingdom and cement your rule. The special buildings can only be built by settling your warriors, missionaries, farmers and traders in the towns on the game board. You must do all this before the level of civil unrest rises (through out of control rebellions and invasions) and before the Norman invasion of 1066.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 3.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Richard Wilkins"], "categories": ["Medieval", "Print & Play"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Seofan", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 180, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 1}, "111726": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 1, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1187922.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 1, "trading": 0, "id": 111726, "yearpublished": 1966, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1187922_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Tri-ang"], "families": ["Sports: Football / Soccer"], "description": "Contents<br/>1 Surface Area.<br/>11 Red Bulb Covers.<br/>11 Yellow Bulb Covers.<br/>1 White Bulb Cover.<br/>1 Question/Answer Booklet.<br/>Rules Are Printed on Inner Box Lid.<br/><br/>An electric (battery operated) quiz game, based on the early days of a BBC game show with this name.

The game comprises of a revolving green plastic base which looks a little bit like a small green hill. On the top of the hill you place a small plastic model of Peter Pan. He doesn't serve any purpose in the game at all, but the girls quite like him! There are eight plastic bluebell cups which are placed over eight holes on the revolving board. Under one of these is placed a small Tinker Bell fairy and the aim of the game is to discover exactly where she is! You might think this all depends on guess work but it does not because Tinker Bell makes a 'tinkle bell' sound when she moves.<br/><br/>So how does the game work? After you have put all the above pieces in place, each player then receive a number of playing cards. These have pictures of Peter Pan, Wendy, John and Michael, and depending which cards you have determines whether you can spin the revolving board or not! It does not tell you who should go first in the instructions but we normally say it is the youngest player. So if that player has the appropriate card, they can trade it in for a spin of the board. And this is what happens...<br/><br/>Firstly they have to be quite careful because if the board is spun too heavily all the bluebells will go flying. If you spin it too gently Tinker Bell will not make a sound. Therefore, the key to success in this game is getting your spin just right! If you do, the board should spin round and you should hear some tinkling music which hopefully should lead you to working out which bluebell Tinker Bell is hiding under! Now this is actually easier said than done! As an adult with probably better levels of concentration than my daughters, I find it quite difficult. You really need to have total quiet and place your ear as close to the board as you can! Then it is possible to get a good idea where she is although I still think it comes doen to a certain amount of luck!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": [], "categories": ["Children's Game", "Fantasy", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "name": "Where's Tinker Bell?", "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 4.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "111730": {"mechanics": ["Point to Point Movement", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1386421.png", "wishing": 0, "owned": 2, "trading": 0, "id": 111730, "yearpublished": 1960, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1386421_t.png", "publishers": ["N\u00fcrburg Spiele"], "families": ["Sports: Auto Racing"], "description": "Contents<br/>1 Game Board.<br/>1 Dice.<br/>1 Playing Piece Car.<br/>3 Playing Piece Motorcycles.<br/>1 Rules Sheet.<br/><br/>Simple die rolling game.

Dysentery and other infectious illnesses arising from the unhealthy swampland killed thousands and incapacitated many more, causing the abandonment of the inglorious expedition.<br/>The British lost over 4,000 men to a disease called &quot;Walcheren Fever&quot;, thought to be a combination of malaria and typhus.<br/><br/>The French player has two options:<br/>1- attack the British columns try to delay their advance<br/>2- retreat inside Flushing and flood the area nearby (mining the dams)<br/><br/>Victory is assigned to the British player by controlling the fortress of Flushing. The French player wins if  he has the control of Flushing while having eliminated 10 British units.

Using just a standard deck of playing cards and a record sheet, the player defends a city against a stream of attackers, trying to hold out until the deck is exhausted, at which time a score may be figured based on how well the city survived.<br/><br/>Originally created on a business flight because I wish I had something I could play on a tiny airplane tray and all I had was a deck of cards and a notebook, it has been playtested and developed further as a submission for the Solitaire Print and Play Contest in July 2011.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/>The record sheet divides a city into four sections, each with defenders, walls and city ratings. Each turn, the player will use hand cards to generate reinforcements, repairs, defensive sorties and other special actions based on the rank and suit of the cards he has. Afterward, the enemy troops appear based on card draws where each suit corresponds to a quadrant of the city and the rank indicates strength. However, each suit of enemy has an ability or advantage that makes them a little different from each other when attacking or appearing. The attack process is straightforward and occurs automatically each round after both the player and the enemy have played their cards.<br/><br/>Over the course of the game the player may make more informed decisions about how to spend his cards based on which cards he's already seen come out of the deck, but luck (good and bad) is still present in which cards he gets in hand to spend and where and in what order the enemies arrive. Many cards can be spent in more than one way by the player, so there is a degree of hand management as well.<br/><br/>The game is designed to play with a standard deck of cards and a record sheet, making this a very portable, small-footprint game. I've played it holding the whole deck in one hand and simply placing the discards face-up at the bottom of the deck, while making my notes and tracking information on the record sheet.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 1.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Michael Haverty"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Print & Play"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Deck Siege", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 15, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 6.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.41421, "numcomments": 17}, "103573": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Variable Player Powers"], "usersrated": 32, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1317518.jpg", "wishing": 9, "owned": 87, "trading": 6, "id": 103573, "yearpublished": 2012, "maxplayers": 8, "numweights": 2, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1317518_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Scallywags International"], "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "description": "It&rsquo;s the golden age of piracy, where cutthroats and scurvy dogs sail the seas and raid villages in search of plunder.

Players must exercise the highest level of caution because a rotten plank of wood in the bridge might break at any time, causing the player &ndash; or worse, some of the precious treasure &ndash; to plunge into the gorge. What's more, the other treasure hunters will be only too glad to pilfer your finds should you give them the chance.<br/><br/>The goal in Die Br&uuml;cke am Rio D'Oro is to cross the bridge (a 3D structure inside the box), grab the treasure and cross the bridge again to return the treasure to your camp. On your turn, you roll a number of dice to determine how far you move. Each die face shows how far you must move and possibly some event:<br/><br/>     Danger, which adds another die roll which may cause the bridge to (partly) collapse at your location, or may cause you to lose a treasure;<br/>     Repair, which allows you to repair a damaged part of the bridge;<br/>     Pilfer, which allows you to steal a treasure from another player, if you land on his location.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>There are three dice: a green die, which in general permits only slow, but safe movement, a yellow die, which gives a good chance to pilfer treasure, and a red die, which allows for fast, but risky movement.

After rolling, you select one die to execute.<br/><br/>If you reach the treasure cave, you can immediately claim up to three treasures. If you reach your camp, you may unload your treasures and prepare for the next crossing. If you end your move at a gap in the bridge, or if the bridge collapses under you, any treasures you are carrying are lost in the river, and you return to your base camp.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the cave holds 25 treasures.

The world's superpowers have developed unprecedented weaponry, including lasers, phaser cannons, and massive combat walkers. These war machines stride across the battlefield, protected by their heavy armor, and devastate enemy troops with their fearsome cannons.<br/><br/>In Dust Warfare, players assume the roles of generals, each commanding a custom-built army of squads, walkers, and heroes. Draw upon Axis might or Allied versatility as you wage ferocious battles for control of the rare ore, VK, needed to fuel the most powerful of the superpowers' weapons.<br/><br/>The Dust Warfare rulebook introduces unprecedented player engagement. Players first get drawn into the action during the Command Phase, where you have to choose how to spend command points during an escalating battle. You might spend command points early and often to advance and sustain an early lead, or you might save them up for dramatic late-game effects that may decisively turn the tide of battle. The Command Phase presents players with the chance to exert their influence and command style upon the field of battle in an engaging new way.<br/><br/>Players have the chance to activate all their forces during the Unit Phase, and reaction mechanisms keep you fully engaged throughout your opponent's turns. As enemy units close in on yours or begin to open fire, you can choose to spend actions from your next turn to react. Keen commanders will make good use of their reaction options. They will also learn how best to feint and bait their opponents to react, draining them of available actions.<br/><br/>Designed by renowned miniatures guru Andy Chambers, the Dust Warfare: Core Rulebook integrates dynamic and engaging new game design with the stunning models from Dust Tactics. Dust Warfare players build armies from the exact same set of miniatures as Dust Tactics.

The game is played in rounds, with each round consisting of four phases:<br/><br/>Each round starts with the Event phase, in which a random event may occur that affects all players.<br/><br/>The next phase is the Supply phase. Each player receives five random resource cards, plus one resource card for each caravel (a type of development card) that he owns, chosen from a common pool.<br/><br/>Then, during the Trade phase, the players trade some of their cards. One of the players, the Trade Master, determines how many resource cards (2, 3 or 4) each player must offer for trade. The player that offers the resources with the highest value becomes the new Trade Master. He chooses one of the resources offered by one of the other players, and adds it to his hand, or exchanges it with a card from the market (three face-up cards that are available for such exchanges).

It's a mad rush to the murder trial, and the Mastermind is doing his or her best to confound the investigations, with an ability to lie.<br/><br/>The fifth player will play the reporter &ndash; and true to form of the unrelenting paparazzi &ndash; will ambush players at locations to query them or shadow players and learn what they learn. Their objective? Get the expos&eacute; before the trial even commences.<br/><br/>At the trial, players will start presenting their accusations in court on what the murder evidence, motive, and witness are and where the crime was committed as well as the mastermind behind the murder. The trial will gradually build up to a scintillating climax where the player who has placed the most correct accusation tokens wins. However, if not enough of the case has been built up, the Mastermind will walk free. Will justice ultimately prevail?

The guardian of the seventh Enki-Des, Enko-Rochimga, cannot be defeated in physical combat. Instead, the Ukri must present his or her Enko-ori, or essence pearl, to prove him- or herself worthy of entering Furrma, or paradise.<br/><br/>In Enki-Des, you play a young Ukri warrior who dies on the battlefield.

You roll three dice, then select two of them and use them to select an action from the action chart.  Alternatively, you can select just one die and lock it into place for use next turn.  Choose your action carefully, though; the guardian will not let up attacking until you are dead.  And don't forget to search for your Enko-ori!

The longer the stream of ascending numbers, the more points she scores.<br/><br/>Once twenty tiles have been drawn and the scoresheets filled, players tally their points for each stream of non-descending numbers, and the high score wins.<br/><br/>The second edition of Streams includes normal and expert rules.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 1.2, "bayesaverage": 5.64488, "designers": ["Yoshihisa Itsubaki"], "categories": ["Math", "Number", "Party Game", "Puzzle"], "name": "20 Express", "playingtime": 10, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "4587"}], "average": 6.35223, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.19537, "numcomments": 46}, "103821": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 1, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1068241.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 103821, "yearpublished": 1977, "maxplayers": 3, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1068241_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Zzota Games"], "families": [], "description": "In 1977, to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth's reign, ZZota Games published a small boxed set of two games.

Players alternate placing tokens on a 4 x 4 grid (with an extra space in the bottom left).  Tokens must be placed in a proscribed order (red then white then blue).

One player will hide a token in a hand and present both hands to the active player, who will select one.  If the hand without the token is chosen, the active player advances on the track, otherwise it is the next player's turn.  Some spaces will cause the token to advance further, and landing on a space occupied by another token will send that token backward on the track.

A bright sunny day &ndash; scarlet strawberries, sweet-scented raspberries, tasty apples, still warm pink scum, the humming of bees... Or a winter evening &ndash; cold outside, warm inside, a burning lamp, tea is ready &ndash; all that's left to choose is cherry or peach? Gooseberry or currant? Why not open a few jars and taste some of each. Of and it would be lovely to bake some pies with jam...<br/><br/>Now you can not only eat jam, you can play The Jam. In this game you need to make all sorts of jam and bake pies. At the start of the game each player has a hand of four cards and a task sheet; the sheet shows different combinations of jam and pies that you need to make to earn extra points at the end of the game. Players receive points by completing tasks, and also for each jam they make and each pie they bake. The one who has the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>All cards in the game can be used as either an Ingredient (the image at the bottom of the card) or a Recipe (jam, pies or fruit salad &ndash; the upper part of the card). At the beginning of the game the top eight cards are placed on the table face up, forming the Basket with Ingredients, fruits and berries.<br/><br/>How do we make jam? A player plays a jam Recipe from his hand, then places the necessary Ingredient on top of it, which he takes from the Basket (&quot;Raspberry jam&quot; from the hand + Raspberry from the Basket and so on). Fruit salad and pies are made a similar way, only to make a pie you need to use a completed jam Recipe (by yourself or one you received from trade) instead of taking it from the Basket.<br/><br/>The game is turn-based, and each player's turn has a few phases:<br/><br/><br/>     Draw a card &ndash; take the top card from the deck.<br/>     Trade &ndash; players can trade Recipes they made with other players.<br/>     Play a card &ndash; you can make jam, bake pies, make a fruit salad; you can use one of the special rules; finally you can play a card as an Ingredient and place it in the Basket.<br/>     Discard &ndash; you must discard Ingredients used to make a Recipe on your previous turn. <br/><br/><br/>The game has a few special cards with special features:<br/><br/><br/>     &quot;The Bear&quot; goes to the player with the most baked pies and awards him 10 points &ndash; but eats one of the pies.<br/>     &quot;Karlsman&quot; goes to the player who can offer him the most jam; he grants 7 points but eats the jam.<br/>     &quot;Cone jam&quot; can be made using any Ingredient, and can then be used to make any pie.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends once all the cards are used, including cards in the players' hands. Points are counted to see who the winner is. Different players complete the tasks on their task sheets differently: Some try to make &quot;Winter jam&quot; or bake &quot;Pies for granny&quot;, while others collect &quot;Favorite fruit&quot;.

The board has a set of tiles fixed solidly onto it; the remaining tiles slide in and out of the rows created by the fixed tiles to make up the labyrinth. One tile stands outside the labyrinth, and on a player's turn, he takes this tile and slides it into a row, moving all the tiles and pushing one out the other side of the board, which becomes the piece for the next player to add to the maze.<br/><br/>After inserting the tile, the player may move his pawn. Each player starts on a corner of the game board and must reach the starting location diagonally opposite. If he manages to do so, he gains a number of magic stones. A player can also acquire magic stones from the inhabitants of the labyrinth. If a player lands on an inhabitant, it tells the players what item it desires. A player who finds the item, with items being scattered throughout the labyrinth, can deliver it to the inhabitant for a reward. What's more, an inhabitant may give a visiting player a treasure chest to be delivered to another inhabitant, also for a reward.<br/><br/>In order to complete his magic key and free the wizard, a player needs fifteen magic stones. The first player that returns to his starting location with a complete key wins.<br/><br/>The game comes with a &quot;book&quot; containing electronics. This book takes care of all the interactions with the inhabitants of the labyrinth. Whenever a player interacts with an inhabitant, he pushes the corresponding buttons from the book, and the book will respond by telling the player his assignment, reward, etc.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "bayesaverage": 5.58745, "designers": ["Reiner Knizia", "Max J.

Damage, for example, is determined through dice and applied in the form of a shuffled Damage Deck. For some hits your fighter sustains, you'll draw a card that assigns a special handicap. Was your targeting computer damaged, affecting your ability to acquire a lock on the enemy? Perhaps an ill-timed weapon malfunction will limit your offensive capabilities. Or worse yet, your pilot could be injured, compromising his ability to focus on the life-and-death struggle in which he is engaged...<br/><br/>The Star Wars: X-Wing starter set includes everything you need to begin your battles, such as scenarios, cards, and fully assembled and painted ships. What's more, Star Wars: X-Wing's quick-to-learn ruleset establishes the foundation for a system that can be expanded with your favorite ships and characters from the Star Wars universe.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.4694, "bayesaverage": 7.67859, "designers": ["Steven Kimball", "James Kniffen", "Corey Konieczka", "Jason Little", "Brady Sadler", "Adam Sadler"], "categories": ["Aviation / Flight", "Bluffing", "Collectible Components", "Miniatures", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "name": "Star Wars X-Wing: El juego de miniaturas \u2013 Caja B\u00e1sica", "playingtime": 45, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "47"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "22"}], "average": 7.89171, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.39145, "numcomments": 2873}, "103886": {"mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "usersrated": 4144, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1474141.jpg", "wishing": 775, "owned": 7868, "trading": 437, "id": 103886, "yearpublished": 2012, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 247, "wanting": 145, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1474141_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Edge Entertainment", "Fantasy Flight Games", "Galakta", "Giochi Uniti", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Hobby World", "Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.", "Wargames Club Publishing", "White Goblin Games"], "families": ["CCGs (Collectible Card Games)", "Living Card Game", "Star Wars", "Star Wars: The Card Game LCG"], "description": "It is a dark time for the galaxy. The Galactic Empire has consolidated its dominion through the might of the Imperial Navy. In the underworld of the Empire's most populated planets, and in strongholds throughout the Outer Rim, powerful gangsters rule vast criminal organizations. From the shadows, those lost to the grip of the dark side of the Force scheme to bring their evil designs to bear on an already oppressed galaxy.<br/><br/>Yet not all hope is lost. The Rebel Alliance resists the iron grip of the Empire. Smugglers and other fringe elements lend their aid to the Rebellion. And unknown to the Emperor and his dark minions of the Sith, the last remnants of the noble Jedi Order work tirelessly to restore peace and order to the galaxy.<br/><br/>Star Wars: The Card Game is a two-player card game that puts one player in command of the Rebels (light side, with the factions Jedi, Rebel Alliance, and Smugglers And Spies), and one player in command of the Empire (dark side, with the factions Sith, Imperial Navy, and Scum And Villainy). The Balance of the Force expansion allows multi-player games. The game is set within the time-frame of the original Star Wars trilogy.<br/><br/>Each player has a deck of objective cards representing various missions plus a deck of player cards of units (characters, vehicles, droids and creatures), events, enhancements and fates. Each objective is linked to a set of five player cards. Deck construction consists of choosing which objectives are to go into your objective deck, then adding each of those objective's set of five player cards to your player deck. Game play consists of deploying cards to your tableau, attacking your opponent's objectives, defending your own objectives, and committing cards to the Force Struggle.<br/><br/>The Empire wins if the Death Star dial reaches 12, with this dial increasing by one on each dark side turn, effectively putting a timer on the game. It may also be increased by winning the Force struggle, destroying light side objectives, and via card effects. The Rebels win by destroying three dark side objectives before the Empire wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.9352, "bayesaverage": 7.00187, "designers": ["Eric M.

For 1 to 2 players (expandable to 3 to 4 with a 2nd copy), IIGD is set in a world overrun by zombies. Unlike virtually every other Zombie game, your goal is not to survive, but to kill as many zombies as possible before you die, which results in very engrossing solo or cooperative play.<br/><br/>IIGD puts you smack in the middle of a hopeless scenario where endless zombies lurch and ramble toward you, never stopping until you are dead or become one of them (Zead). You must gather and use weapons and resources to take as many of the abominations as you can with you.<br/><br/>Zombies enter the playing area from several &quot;Entry&quot; points depending on the scenario. You can take actions during your turn such as Attack, Use an Item, or Search for Resources. Each turn the Zombies will be moved closer and closer and eventually the resources will run out...<br/><br/>Random events or &quot;Occurrences&quot; that come into play and change the rules keep the game fresh and different every time. The game may be played in a sort of &quot;Kill em All&quot; mode where you simply try to achieve the best score or you can play one of several Story Arcs that add entertaining story lines to the game where how well you do determines what happens in the story after you die.<br/><br/>The unique mechanisms of the Fate Deck &ndash; which determines whether you find a resource when searching and whether you &quot;hit&quot; or &quot;miss&quot; during an attack &ndash; and the Tracker cards &ndash; which are used to keep track of health, ammo, and inventory &ndash; make this a game unlike any you have seen before.<br/><br/>One other thing that makes this game unique in the Zombie genre is that each Zombie is illustrated with AMAZING detail and has a character all its own. You may just become more invested in the story of the Zombies than you are in the characters you play!<br/><br/>IIGD allows for some level of creative control for players who have interest in making their own layouts and scenarios.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 1.4286, "bayesaverage": 5.55854, "designers": ["A.

How true this is can be debated, but this is the only place where energy still flows freely in its purest form.

From there, players can introduce the special rules for each of the elemental warriors one at a time to learn the full Advanced game. Each warrior has two unique skills that differentiate it from the others. Being able to move all of your warriors on the board gives an enormous amount of tactical options.

To earn money or prosperity points, you may also draw on the sand*, carry tourists all over Vanuatu islands, or trade cargo with foreign countries.<br/> On each turn, the archipelago expands and you have to program your actions with five tokens. You put one or more of them on the chosen action spaces, and on your turn, you will only be able to play an action if you have the majority on its space. Thus, sometimes have to wait for other players to remove their tokens by playing their actions. If you are not in majority anywhere, you have to remove all of your tokens from an action and give up hope of playing this action. A good strategy lets you block other players; for example, they won't be able to sell fishes if they haven't caught them first &ndash; order matters! Islands and sea resources are rare, so be quick and take them first!<br/><br/>There is no such thing as a rich Vanuatuan. When you reach ten vatus, they automatically transform into 5 prosperity points and again, you are poor.

The first team to get round the board once wins.<br/><br/>Each team randomly draws three category tiles and arranges them on the board according to how knowledgeable they think they are in this particular area. A team will usually put the tile with their &quot;worst&quot; category in the first slot and their &quot;best&quot; category in the third slot. If they answer the question from their first category correctly, they score one point, two for the second, and three for the third. After a round has been completed (i.e. each team has been asked three questions), the category tiles are redrawn.<br/><br/>Each team also has 3 switches on the board that they can activate once per round. One is labelled with a &quot;Z&quot;, the other two are labelled with a &quot;B&quot;. The &quot;Z&quot; switch allows a team to swap one of their categories with another team. The &quot;B&quot; switch allows a team to challenge the active team. If the active team can't answer their question but the challenging team can, they earn extra points (one if they used the switch after the question was asked, and three if they used it before even knowing the question).

Seven nuclear reactors and two airfields are scattered amongst the landscape hexes that make up the remainder of the country. At the start of the game, your color-coded twenty people and three vehicles (car, bus, helicopter) are placed on their designated hexes. You need to get them to the airfields to save them, preferably before they absorb too much radiation. You can airlift a vehicle out of an airfield, too, to save the driver, but then you have fewer opportunities to save more people.<br/><br/>Each turn proceeds as follows:<br/><br/><br/>    Radiation outburst &ndash; Roll the eight-sided die and place a radiation counter on the numbered reactor (or nowhere if an 8 is rolled).<br/>    Move buses &ndash; In player order, move a bus up to two spaces, with a maximum of four passengers at any one time.

Forty-two connection cards are laid face-up on the table (grouped as desired by the players), along with multipliers of value 2, 3 and 4.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player can play cards from his hand to create any of the connections on a card. The player can simultaneously rearrange cards on the table to create new compounds, using the multiplier cards as needed to create molecules like O2 or H2O.

The chaotic streets hum with the sounds of bustling crowds and busy commerce. Cargo ships constantly arrive and depart from the port. Demand is continuous, if unpredictable, for a supply of local products such as exotic fruits, sugar, rum, tobacco, and cigars.<br/><br/>In Santiago de Cuba, your business card says &quot;broker&quot;, but in reality you're a shady wheeler-dealer who arranges deals with the locals and with corruptible officials to move goods and meet the demand of those ever-present cargo ships &ndash; and your ability to procure these goods is only as reliable as your &quot;connections&quot;.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, nine locals &ndash; the Cubans &ndash; are randomly arranged on a path around Santiago, with the port being the tenth location on the circuit. Each Cuban has a different ability: e.g., give a player two tobacco, give a player a good of his choice, force opponents to give you something, give money or victory points (VPs), and seize a building or allow a player to use a previously seized building. What are these buildings? At the start of the game, twelve buildings are randomly placed on the game board in four color-coded groups (white, yellow, etc.) of three. As with the Cubans, these buildings give players a special ability when used: convert tobacco to cigars, change VPs to money or vica versa, increase the value of goods delivered to the ship, render a Cuban inactive for the next round, and so on.<br/><br/>Players will deliver goods to seven ships throughout the course of the game. The demand for each ship is determined via a die roll; the active player rolls five dice &ndash; one for each type of good &ndash; then chooses four of the values rolled to represent demand for goods of the same color as the die.<br/><br/>All players share a car and travel around the island together. On a turn, the active player can move the car to the next location on the path (whether Cuban or port) for free, or pay one peso for each spot moved beyond that. After taking a Cuban action, the player then must move his player piece to a building of the same color as the flower on that Cuban. If he takes an action in a building owned by someone else, that player earns 1 VP. (One Cuban allows a player to use the same building where his piece is currently located.)<br/><br/>If a player moves to port, players take turns delivering all goods of one type to the ship to meet demand, adjusting the demand dice as needed. A player earns 2-4 VP for each good delivered; a player doesn't have to deliver goods. If the ship's demand isn't met after everyone delivers or passes, the VP bounty per good is increased by one and the ship remains in place &ndash; unless the value was already at 4 VP, in which case the ship sails. In this case, or when all the demand is met, a new ship comes into port with new demand values.<br/><br/>After seven ships have sailed, the players earn 1 VP for every three goods still on hand, then tally their VPs. The player with the most VPs wins, with ties broken by goods remaining, then money.<br/><br/>Each game poses new tactical challenges for the players, thanks to ever-changing combinations of buildings, Cuban inhabitants and demand for goods.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.1822, "bayesaverage": 6.60626, "designers": ["Michael Rieneck"], "categories": ["Economic"], "name": "Santiago de Cuba", "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "675"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "410"}], "average": 6.94143, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.14357, "numcomments": 595}, "104349": {"mechanics": ["Partnerships", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "usersrated": 1, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1060273.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "trading": 0, "id": 104349, "yearpublished": 2008, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1060273_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Copulus"], "families": [], "description": "From the publisher:<br/>Pillow Talk: The Sensual Relationship Game is a personal growth game, which uses sexuality to help couples resolve personal and relationship issues.<br/><br/>The purpose of Pillow Talk is to:<br/><br/>    Inspire and initiate intimate conversation between couples.<br/>    Help couples practice open and honest communication and their relationship and sexuality.<br/>    Increase couples intimate knowledge of themselves and their partners.<br/>    Learn how to &lsquo;let go&rsquo; of past experiences, issues, and patterns in loving relationships.<br/>    Help individuals and couples work through and &lsquo;let go&rsquo; of the most common issues that arise in any intimate relationship.<br/>    Spoil, pamper, and treat couples to sensual and erotic interplay.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Pillow Talk: The Sensual Relationship Game is modeled after the ancient race game, &lsquo;Snakes and Ladders.&rsquo; However, with Pillow Talk, players go up &lsquo;whips&rsquo; and down &lsquo;chains&rsquo; to the appropriate square.

Set 3,000 years before the events of Twilight Imperium, Rex tells the story of the last days of the Lazax empire, while presenting players with compelling asymmetrical racial abilities and exciting opportunities for diplomacy, deception, and tactical mastery.<br/><br/>In Rex: Final Days of an Empire, players vie for control of vital locations across a sprawling map of the continent-sized Mecatol City. Only by securing three key locations (or more, when allied with other factions) can a player assert dominance over the heart of a dying empire.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, mustering troops in the face of an ongoing Sol blockade is difficult at best (unless, of course, you are the Federation of Sol or its faithless ally, the Hacan, who supply the blockading fleet). Savvy leaders must gather support from the local populace, uncover hidden weapon caches, and acquire control over key institutions. Mechanically, this means players must lay claim to areas that provide influence, which is then &quot;spent&quot; to (among other things) smuggle military forces through the orbiting Sol blockade. Those forces will be needed to seize the key areas of the city required to win the game. From the moment the first shot is fired, players must aggressively seek the means by which to turn the conflict to their own advantage.<br/><br/>While the great races struggle for supremacy in the power vacuum of a dead emperor, massive Sol warships execute their devastating bombardments of the city below. Moving systematically, the Federation of Sol's fleet of warships wreaks havoc on the planet's surface, targeting great swaths of the game board with their destructive capabilities. Only the Sol's own ground forces have forewarning of the fleet's wrath; all others must seek shelter in the few locations with working defensive shields...or be obliterated in the resulting firestorm.<br/><br/>Although open diplomacy and back-door dealmaking can often mitigate the need for bloodshed, direct combat may prove inevitable. When two or more opposing forces occupy the same area, a battle results. Each player's military strength is based on the sum total of troops he is willing to expend, along with the strength rating of his chosen leader. A faction's leaders can therefore be vitally important in combat...but beware! One or more of your Leaders may secretly be in the employ of an enemy, and if your forces in combat are commanded by such a traitor, defeat is all but assured. So whether on the field of battle or the floor of the Galactic Council, be careful in whom you place your trust.<br/><br/>All this, along with a host of optional rules and additional variants, means that no two games of Rex: Final Days of an Empire will play exactly alike. Contributing further to replayability is the game's asymmetrical faction abilities, each of which offer a unique play experience.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 3.2593, "bayesaverage": 6.78315, "designers": ["Bill Eberle", "John Goodenough", "Jack Kittredge", "Corey Konieczka", "Peter Olotka", "Christian T.

Before the first round, a player receives three wizards, warriors and dwarfs and one artifact. (When playing with fewer than four players, deal out hands to virtual players; these are not used during the current round.) Set up the keep by placing one monster and one treasure tile face up on each of the three levels.<br/><br/>Players now assault the keep, trying to avoid the monsters and claim treasure. On the first level, players choose one card from their hand, reveal it, choose another, reveal it, choose a third, and reveal it. A player must create a team of adventurers with three different colors, and the strengths of these teams (the sum of the cards' values) are then compared. (The chameleon wizard with a ? equals the strongest wizard on the table. The artifact doubles the weakest character on your team.) The weakest team gets the monster card, which costs points, and the strongest team gets the treasure card, usually positive points. Ties are broken in favor of the strongest wizard, then in favor of the wizard with the wand, then the strongest warrior, and so on.<br/><br/>On the second level, players reveal one card, then a pair of cards, then compare strengths. On the third level, players reveal three cards at the same time. Players then compare the last card in hand, gaining 0-3 gold depending on the strength of that final card.<br/><br/>Once all ten cards have been played, each player passes his whole hand to his left neighbour, a new dungeon is created, and you now play with the same cards as the player sitting to your right. After four rounds, the game ends and players tally their points.

That makes the Polish player feels like he can be really outmaneuvred by the Germans.<br/><br/>Important factor is use of the air force.

But do not worry, PL gains VP either for holding terrain objectives or inflicting causalties to German units. German player must eliminate PL unit to gain VP for it. Therefore, usually the Polish player has more VP during the game - and the German player must perform a really good Blitzkrieg to gain victory.<br/><br/>What is more, the players will get a chance to play the Red Blitzkireg scenario, and check how Polish Army can act vs. the Red Army. This scenario shows the actual Soviet deployment of 1939 versus Polish defense plan East, which was only theoretical.<br/><br/>Another what if scenario is Czechoslovakian defense of 1938, supposing that the Munich dictate was rejected. There are quite heavy fortifications along the border, and the Wehrmacht isn't as strong as it was it 1939.

For four years the Great Patriotic War continued. Millions of soldiers, thousands of tanks and planes &ndash; the entire might of USSR , Great Britain , France and many other countries were sent to battle. In the end fascist Germany was defeated.<br/><br/>The strategic card game &ldquo;Victory Day&rdquo; is dedicated to the last period of the war when soviet soldiers assaulted Berlin and completely broke the German forces. Each player takes on the role of a division commander. He has command over different units: infantry, armored vehicles, artillery and aviation.<br/><br/>Each unit has a historic counterpart &ndash; so for instance each rifle company in the game is a counterpart of real life divisions, platoons of KV tanks and T-34s, batteries of &ldquo;Katusha&rdquo; rocket launchers, squadrons of LA-7s and Tu-2 and so on. All in game characteristics were done keeping in mind the actual abilities of the historic counterparts. By using special &ldquo;tactical cards&rdquo; you can use different assaults, tactical maneuvers and psychological effects. Throughout the game, players simulate different actions of their divisions: charges and break through, artillery support and aerial bombings, organization off defenses and blocking enemy troops.<br/><br/>All units in the game and all game events are shown as cards. Each card has an image of the unit, it's characteristics and abilities and also a text &ndash; usually it's a quotation from a historical novel or memoires, or some information on the current unit. All illustrations on the cards are done from actual black and white photos done during the war by using computer technologies.<br/><br/>Booster packs containing new cards have been released for &ldquo;Victory Day&rdquo;. Players can add any of these cards to their decks by purchasing the booster packs sold separately. This way, players can make their own unique decks by adding new cards to it. Depending on the cards in the deck victory may be easier than before. It's more important to have a balanced deck fit for different situations then just by adding strong cards. But both players need to have an equal amount of cards in their decks. It is also not recommended to have more than 60 cards in the deck.<br/><br/>There is also a mmo game based on &ldquo;Victory Day&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;The War Online&rdquo;<br/><br/>Victory Day&rdquo; the board game is based mostly on &ldquo;The War&rdquo; CCG.

For their chastened opponents, Allied operations in this theater of the war were limited to raids and small-scale offensives as war efforts in North Africa and Europe, as well as the South Pacific, drew higher priorities for resources and personnel. For much of 1943 and early 1944 the fighting in Burma was relegated to WWII's backwater by both sides. With the end of the monsoon season in 1944 the strategic situation had changed. Not only were Japanese fortunes declining precipitously elsewhere, but the build-up in Allied forces along the Burma/India border did not go unnoticed. Determined to pre-empt any Allied attack, the Japanese launched an offensive of their own in May, the largest they ever launched outside of China, against the Allied positions in and around Imphal and Kohima. The battles that raged among the jungles and mountainous hillsides of the Indian and Burma frontier, and the subsequent Allied victory that followed in July, marked a fundamental and permanent shift in the war. The Allied offensive in March 1945 was one marked by extensive planning and preparation, as well bold and daring maneuvers that not only took the Commonwealth and Indian forces across the Irrawaddy River to Rangoon, but crushed the defending Imperial Japanese Burma Area Army.<br/><br/>Defeat into Victory, by designer Paul Rohrbaugh, covers this neglected aspect of WWII history using a very interactive and easy to play design. The game has one 22&quot; by 34&quot; hex map that stretches from Dimapur in the north to Rangoon in the south. A countersheet with 280 half-inch units (mostly brigade and regiments in size) and approximately 16 pages of rules and charts round out the package. The game uses a chit-pull activation system. Rules cover supply (a crucial aspect in terrain that was among the most inhospitable of the war), various types of combat (fire, maneuver and assault), as well as morale and leadership. Rules also include random events (that simulate the effects of battles and decisions by higher-ups elsewhere), weather, Japanese suicide tank attacks (human combat destruction squads) and changing war goals. The air campaign is also simulated (in much more detail than generic &quot;air points&quot;). Scenarios include the initial Japanese offensive against Imphal and Kohima, two on the Allied 1945 offensive, as well as the Campaign Game. Tough decisions will have to be made by both sides as they allocate precious resources among their formations, determine their enemy's intentions and balance their plans, as well as attack and defend. &quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 3.2, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Paul Rohrbaugh", "Lembit Tohver"], "categories": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Defeat Into Victory: The Final Campaigns in Burma", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 180, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 6.53365, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.78573, "numcomments": 23}, "104969": {"mechanics": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1079225.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 104969, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1079225_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Self-Published)"], "families": [], "description": "Each player controls a clan in the Highlands or Lowlands of Scotland.

Unfortunately, the river also contributed to its troubles, because in 881, the Normans traversed its watery path, and thereby easily captured the city. That act of aggression stunted Tournay's prosperity. This game invites you to participate in the reconstruction of the city, in order to establish a glorious era that will last for more than seven centuries. Help your district flourish by cleverly coordinating the work of the city's three domains: military, religious, and civil. Certainly the prestige of your buildings will brighten the entire city!<br/><br/>Tournay is a card game from the same designing team as the 2010 release Troyes with artwork once again by Alexandre Roche. In this game, players manage a district of the city and its three classes of citizens. The cards are classified by level (I to III) and color to form nine distinct decks. Players initially have two citizens in each class that they will use each turn to carry out one of five available actions, such as drawing cards, or using the powers of their buildings.<br/><br/>In each player's district, the building cards save them money, make more efficient use of the decks of cards, or recruit new citizens. The character cards optimize the use of buildings if properly positioned. It's up to you to create the most effective card combinations. Finally, constructed prestige buildings will give you valuable prestige points, depending on how your district has developed. But beware: Your opponents will also benefit from every prestige building you build!<br/><br/>Note that an expansion is included in the base game's box, so advanced players can add still more replay value to this dynamic game!<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>There are 3 sets of cards (yellow, red, white) in 3 groups (I, II, III); also, a set of black event cards. There are always 3 face-up event cards, most of which are bad. Players start with 2 meeples in 3 colors (yellow, red, white), placed on their Plaza card.<br/><br/>On your turn:<br/><br/>     First, you may play a card from hand to your display (3x3 grid) by paying the appropriate cost (some combination of coins, meeples, cards, etc). You may play a card on top of another of the same color; if played on top of a different color, discard the older card. <br/>     Then take one action:<br/>         Draw a card; move 1-3 meeples off the Plaza to draw a level I-III card; you may pay others 2 coins to use their worker(s). If you draw the event card of that deck, place a coin on each event card, then trigger all event cards once per coin.<br/>         Activate a building card by moving a meeple from your Plaza to the building card (max 1 Meeple/building); cards do a variety of things like give you coins, recruit an additional meeple, use someone else's card, etc.<br/>         Combat an event by paying the cost (usually 1 Meeple, 1 coin, +1/coin on the card; or, 2 meeples) shown; take the card as a reward. Later, when events trigger, you may play this from hand to prevent an event from affecting you.<br/>         Reactivate all workers: return all meeples to your Plaza, and remove all markers from building cards.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The game ends at the start of the Start Player's turn if 2+ players have all 9 cards in their display; OR if only 1 player has, but at least n-1 Town Crier cards have been revealed. Everyone then gets to play one final card (paying normal costs). Earn VPs for all cards in display, and for all Event cards you've combated.

Who loves whom? And how much?<br/><br/>During the game, each player flirts with all several other players. All the actions &ndash; such as flirting, sending text messages or giving your heart away &ndash; bring in flirting points. Who will flirt the best, gain the most flirting points and become the &quot;best&quot; couple?<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player receives a character (or two characters in a three-player game), two hearts belonging to that character and two relationship tokens, and a pawn, which is placed on the board. Then, each player thinks up a term of endearment for himself. When players address each other, they should use this term of endearment. A player who fails to do so correctly loses a relationship point.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns. On his turn, a player rolls two dice, picks one, and move his pawn as many spaces as the die shows. (In a three-player game, the player rolls one die, and selects one of his pawns to move.) After moving the pawn, the player may flirt with one character of the opposite sex whose pawn is on the same space or an adjacent space. If he does so, this strengthens the relationship between the two characters. This is measured by placing flirting points on the &quot;love barometer&quot;. If two characters have four flirting points, they fall in love. After four more points, they get engaged, and after another four points, they get married.<br/><br/>Furthermore, if the pawn has landed on a heart space, the player may either give one of his hearts to another player, or ask for a heart from another player (who then has to give one of his hearts to the asker).<br/><br/>If the pawn has landed on a text message space, the player draws one of the text message cards, reads it out loud and places it face-down in front of him. If no more cards remain in the draw pile, the player can either give one of his cards away or ask to receive a card from another player (who then has to give one of his cards to the asker).<br/><br/>The game ends when a pair of characters have married. Now, each player scores points as follows:<br/><br/>    For the highest relationship status achieved (with any one other character): 4 points for being in love, 8 points for being engaged and 12 points for having married.<br/>    -1 point for each of your own hearts, +2 points for each heart from another player.<br/>    -1 point for each negative text message, +2 points for each positive text message.<br/>    +1 point for each remaining relationship token.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The player who has scored the most points wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 1.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Wolfgang Kramer", "Bernhard Lach", "Uwe Rapp"], "categories": ["Party Game"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Flirt", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 5.66, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.861626, "numcomments": 5}, "105129": {"mechanics": ["Auction/Bidding", "Dice Rolling"], "usersrated": 4, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1068504.png", "wishing": 4, "owned": 4, "trading": 0, "id": 105129, "yearpublished": 2011, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 1, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1068504_t.png", "publishers": ["Spellcrow"], "families": [], "description": "Umbra Turris is new skirmish level miniatures game in which players control 6-12 heroes, trying to gain fame and wealth in ruins of old, grim city of Umbra Turris.<br/>Using high quality miniatures and free intuitive rules players can assemble and highly customize their own band of heroes and then lead them to death or glory in one of six scenarios provided with rules.

Details on why this is important in the description.<br/><br/>Risk Legacy represents what is if not a new, at least a rare concept to boardgaming: campaigning. At its core, the game, particularly at first, plays much like regular Risk with a few changes. Players control countries or regions on a map of the world, and through simple combat (with players rolling dice to determine who loses units in each battle) they try to eliminate all opponents from the game board or control a certain number of &quot;red stars&quot;, otherwise known as victory points (VPs).<br/><br/>What's different is that Risk Legacy' changes over time based on the outcome of each game and the various choices made by players. In each game, players choose one of five factions; each faction has uniquely shaped pieces, and more importantly, different rules. At the start of the first game, each of these factions gains the ability to break one minor rule, such as the ability to move troops at any time during your turn, as opposed to only at the end.<br/><br/>What makes this game unique is that when powers are chosen, players must choose one of their faction's two powers, affix that power's sticker to their faction card, then destroy the card that has the other rule on it &ndash; and by destroy, the rules mean what they say: &quot;If a card is DESTROYED, it is removed from the game permanently. Rip it up. Throw it in the trash.&quot; This key concept permeates through the game. Some things you do in a game will affect it temporarily, while others will affect it permanently. These changes may include boosting the resources of a country (for recruiting troops in lieu of the older &quot;match three symbols&quot; style of recruiting), adding bonuses or penalties to defending die rolls to countries, or adding permanent continent troop bonuses that may affect all players.<br/><br/>The rule book itself is also designed to change as the game continues, with blocks of blank space on the pages to allow for rules additions or changes. Entire sections of rules will not take effect until later in the game. The game box contains different sealed packages and compartments, each with a written condition for opening. The rule book indicates that these contain the rule additions, additional faction powers, and other things that should not be discussed here for spoiler protection.<br/><br/>The winner of each of the first 15 games receives a &quot;major bonus,&quot; such as founding a major city (which only he will be allowed to start on in future games), deleting a permanent modifier from the board, destroying a country card (preventing it from providing any resources towards purchasing troops in future games), changing a continent troop bonus, or naming a continent, which gives that player a troop bonus in future games. Players who did not win but were not eliminated are allowed to make minor changes to the world, such as founding a minor city or adding resources to a country.<br/><br/>It should be noted that although cards are ripped up over the course of the game, there are so many cards added via the sealed packages, that the game does not suffer. Nor is this a &quot;disposable&quot; game, merely a customized one. The game can continue to change beyond the 15 game campaign, and even when it finally does stop changing, you still have a copy of Risk that is completely unique, and plays better than any other version of Risk.<br/><br/>Initial games take approximately 30-90 minutes to play, which includes a brief rules explanation and setup.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 2.6122, "bayesaverage": 7.24674, "designers": ["Rob Daviau", "Chris Dupuis"], "categories": ["Dice", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "name": "Risiko Evolution", "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "163"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "80"}], "average": 7.59087, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.61299, "numcomments": 1244}, "105136": {"mechanics": ["Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Partnerships", "Role Playing", "Variable Player Powers", "Voting"], "usersrated": 36, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1139469.jpg", "wishing": 38, "owned": 148, "trading": 0, "id": 105136, "yearpublished": 2008, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 2, "wanting": 5, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1139469_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Edge Entertainment", "Fantasy Flight Games"], "families": ["Battlestar Galactica"], "description": "This is a print-and-play expansion and is available online at the FFG website.

It is played on the cells of an initially empty hex hex board. The suggested size is between 6 and 10 cells per side. Both players must have access to a sufficient number of black and white stones.<br/><br/><br/>Definitions<br/><br/>A group is a set of connected, like-colored stones. A single stone is also a group.<br/><br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>Starting with Black, players take turns placing one or two stones of any color on empty cells. On their first turn, Black can only place one stone.<br/><br/>At the end of each turn, there must be an odd number of groups on the board (i.e. the sum of the number of Black and White groups must be an odd number).<br/><br/>Players can pass their turn at any moment, unless it violates the previous rule (this means Black can't pass on their first turn).<br/><br/>When both players pass in succession, the game ends. The player with the fewest groups on the board wins. Draws are not possible.<br/><br/><br/>Notes<br/><br/>Double placement serves both as a first move equalizer and a way to make the game playable under the group restriction rule.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, apart from the intended goal of eliminating draws (they would be common otherwise), forcing an odd number of groups at the end of a turn has some interesting tactical implications which make the game feel similar to a single placement game. For example, groups separated by two empty cells can't be joined on a single turn, since the player runs out of stones to restore the groups count to an odd number. Also, the diamond connection (two stones at each end of a four-cell rhombus) is safe if the opponent has exactly zero or two groups adjacent to the intermediate cells, and unsafe otherwise.<br/><br/>Endgames are also quite tricky under this rule: you'll often want to join two of your own groups or create another opponent group, but you'll be unable to do it because you can't restore the groups count anymore!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Luis Bola\u00f1os Mures"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Print & Play"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Yodd", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 45, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.42727, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 2.39852, "numcomments": 9}, "105179": {"mechanics": ["Voting"], "usersrated": 1, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1071761.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 7, "trading": 1, "id": 105179, "yearpublished": 2011, "maxplayers": 8, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1071761_t.jpg", "publishers": ["S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung"], "families": [], "description": "Open End is a communication game about newspaper headlines.

Not in this naughty game of cards &ndash; in fact, you'll probably have to cheat in order to win.<br/><br/>In Mogel Motte you want to get rid of all the cards in your hand before anyone else. Each player starts the round with a hand of eight cards, with one player (the oldest) receiving the guard bug &ndash; which stays on the table throughout the game &ndash; and one card being turnd face-up to start a discard pile. The cards are numbered 1-5, with the majority of them having only numbers; some cards have special abilities that come into play when added to the discard pile or in a player's hand.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player places one card from her hand onto the discard pile; that card must be numbered exactly one higher or lower than the card on top of the discard pile. (The numbers wrap, so a 1 can be played on a 5 and vice versa.) If a player can't play a card, she draws one from the deck and her turn ends.<br/><br/>There's another way to rid yourself of cards, though: cheating! Throughout the round, you can make cards disappear by dropping them on the floor, hiding them up your sleeve and so on. You must keep your hand of cards above the table at all times, you can't vanish more than one card at once, and you can't rid yourself of your final card this way. The player with the guard bug &ndash; and only him! &ndash; can call out other players for cheating, and no one can cheat while the accusation is being resolved. If the accusation was false, the Guard must draw a card; otherwise the cheating player takes back the card she tried to lose, is given a card from the Guard's hand as additional punishment, and becomes the new Guard.<br/><br/>Cheating is a necessity as the &quot;Cheating Moth&quot; cards can't be played onto the discard pile, but must be disappeared via cheating. (The Guard, however, can play these cards as the Guard is not allowed to cheat.)<br/><br/>The action cards work as follows:<br/><br/><br/>    Ant: After an ant is played, everyone but the active player must take a card from the draw pile.<br/>    Cockroach: After a cockroach is played, everyone races to play an identically-numbered card on top of it. Only the fastest player gets to leave her card in place.<br/>    Mosquito: After a mosquito is played, everyone but the active player must slap the pile of cards. Whoever is slowest receives a card from the hand of all other players.<br/>    Spider: After playing this, give a non-Cheating Moth card from your hand to another player.<br/><br/><br/>When one player has no cards in hand, the round ends. All other players score 10 points for each Cheating Moth in hand, 5 points for each action card, and 1 point for each number card.

These lightly armed parachute units were intended to assault coastal areas, support amphibious landings or seize enemy airfields and other strategic objectives. They were not meant to become entangled in heavy, pitched land battles.

Each piece in this game has a rank that determines the distance it may move, and a directional characteristic which indicates the direction that it may be moved. In this way, each piece represents a vector, having characteristics of both magnitude and direction.<br/><br/>PLAYING SURFACE: Vector Chess is played on a square playing area divided into either 49 or 64 smaller squares of equal size. The squares may be alternately light and dark colored, but it is not necessary. A game played on the board having 49 squares will usually make for a shorter game when compared to a game on the 64 square board.<br/><br/>THE PIECES: Depending upon the type of board used, enough pieces must be used to fill the first two rows of squares on each side of the board, with each piece set facing the opposite side of the board. Only two types of pieces are used in this game: the MAJOR pieces, and the MINOR pieces. The major pieces, which are line up along the first row of the board, have the highest rank and may be moved from one to four spaces along a straight line in the direction that they are pointing. The minor pieces are lined up on the second row of the board, and are identical to the major pieces except that they are shorter and may be moved only one or two spaces in the direction that they are pointing. Each piece in this game maneuvers like a soldier on a battlefield &ndash; it may turn and move to a new position, provided no other piece blocks its path, and it may attack any enemy piece that is directly in its path and within range. The range of movement is the number of spaces that the piece move can move as was previously described.<br/><br/>OBJECT OF THE GAME: The object of the game is to &ldquo;check mate&rdquo; the opposing player by maneuvering pieces into his first row squares until the defending pieces in that row are outnumbered. If the first row squares are empty, only one attacking pieces is required to put the opposing player &ldquo;in check&rdquo;. The defending player must break the check during his next turn as described below, or he will be considered &ldquo;check mated&rdquo;.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS: This game includes 32 round wooden playing pieces in 2 colors that are similar looking to a rook in chess but have a directional arrow in the top. For each player there are 8 'tall' pieces and 8 'short' pieces that otherwise look identical.

It features rules for ascension, sprint, time trial (even a different rule for mountain time trial), and provides mechanism to run a single race.<br/><br/>The board is customisable with the provided little arrows.  It is just a plain 100-field board.Before the race you must decide how long will it be (recommended: 150 to 250 squares long for a one-day race, that is one and a half to two and a half laps) and where you place the different mountains and sprints.<br/><br/>What is puzzling is that you have to remember (and possibly write down) in which lap are placed the mountains. In effect, it is recommended to have three climbs during the race, and each climb takes place in a different lap. The same applies to special sprints. So you end up with a board with too many arrow pointing at mountains and sprints that might or might not be there.<br/>We have six national teams  of 5 riders each, and every rider has different abilities which affect the probability of having a good throw on a given type of road. As you can see in the team cards, riders have values for flat road (LL = &quot;llano&quot;), mountain (M), sprint (S), time trial (CR = &quot;contra reloj&quot;) and mountain time trial (CRM).<br/><br/>On an even closer look, you will guess that good values is the lower one (9) for flat roads (LL) and the higher for mountains sprints and time trials. This is because in flat road riders throw two dice and they have an extra throw if they match their number on the team card (and of course, it is more probable to throw 9 than 12 with two dice, though when you get an extra throw after a double sic, you really advance a lot)<br/><br/>The mountain rule is quite strange. You still throw two dice, but you only advance the value of the blue one. The red dice is just added to the blue to see if you match the number on the card and you have an extra throw.<br/><br/>Similar rules apply to sprint and time trial. Just roll and move. No decisions to be taken. The only strategic issue in the game is the demarrage card. One is given to each player, to be used only once during the race, and giving you an extra throw for one rider. <br/>The game is intended to run a full season, so we have special maillots (yellow, green and rainbow jerseis) medals and a trophy, and rules to decide how many points is worth a given race. <br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": [], "categories": ["Racing", "Sports"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Criterium.

Their problem is overcoming the lack of a true leader that makes it difficult to set aside their rivalries and squabbling. They have speed rivaling the Ottomans but far less of a capacity to use it well. They are a true guerilla force adept at denying their opponents resources or freedom to maneuver.<br/><br/>Tokugawa Shogunate: The Shogunate is crumbling. The army seeks to modernize against the will of the Shogun and in a few years Japan will step into the Industrial age. However, at the turn of the 19th Century, insular clans still dominated the military. Every Daimyo leads his own army into battle with their own guns, cavalry, samurai and teppo. Only the Shogun can be called on to make any Clan work with another.

This often overlooked campaign featured classic land battles, naval engagements between lake flotillas, cruiser duels at sea and finally hit and run guerrilla engagements. It opened with conventional force-on-force battles dominated by infantry, machine guns, and trenches. But the low troop densities and wide open spaces enabled a war of movement spearheaded by South African cavalry that broke the stalemate in mid 1916. This left Von Lettow-Vorbeck a choice between surrender or guerrilla war. He chose the latter and dragged his weary pursuers through a series of running battles in Portuguese East Africa.<br/><br/>Designed by WWI game specialist John Gorkowski, Guns of the Askari features 280 half-inch full color counters that represent forces as varied as rifle companies, armored cars, naval units for oceans or lakes, and the supply units on which both sides depended. There are even artillery units back-printed with the other side&rsquo;s colors, so that they can be captured and used again.<br/><br/>The game offers four different scenarios, from the complete campaign to the 1918 guerrilla operation and two periods in between. Combat mechanics change as the nature of the conflict evolves, and each turn has a variable end point.<br/><br/>The game can be played by two OR THREE players, giving the option for German, British, and Belgian players, and making it possible for the &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; Portuguese to (perhaps) join the German side!<br/><br/>Can you, commanding greatly superior numbers, do better than the Allied commanders?

All placement and balancing rules of Symple apply. However, as opposed to Symple, capture is possible. A group is captured, if it has no liberties anymore. Captured stones are flipped as in Othello, meaning they change color. It is noteworthy that this kind of capture does not create liberties for the capturing group.<br/><br/>SyGo is usually played on a 19x19 square board.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     <a target='_blank' href=\"http://mindsports.nl/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mindsports.nl/</a> - (turn-based)<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Christian Freeling"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "SyGo", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 45, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 1}, "106356": {"mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Trick-taking"], "usersrated": 17, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1469705.jpg", "wishing": 10, "owned": 109, "trading": 11, "id": 106356, "yearpublished": 2011, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 4, "wanting": 4, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1469705_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Self-Published)"], "families": ["Characters: Alice In Wonderland", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "description": "From the designer and Kickstarter project page:<br/><br/>&quot;Borogove is a card game based off Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, And What Alice Found There.

Hence, it does not focus on individual bouts (even though hundreds of fights are simulated during the game), but on the whole of a rikishi's (sumo wrestler) career.<br/><br/>There are 12 rikishi in the game, but only a small number of those are player-controled; the others are 'automated', i.e. controled by the game. The game is intended to be played by a very small number of players or solitaire. In principle it could work with up to 6, but it is recommended for 2 or 3 players.<br/><br/>During a single game year, rikishi first train, which means that they improve their skills in 1 or 2 of 5 different areas of skill (endurance, strength, weight (yes, that's a skill here...), speed, technique). In the meanwhile their oyakata (stable masters, comp. coaches) try to improve their spirits, which works like a 6th skill.<br/><br/>After training the basho (tournament) begins. A whole year of sumo (6 basho) is condensed into a single tournament (of 45 bouts) in the game. Every bout is decided by the match tactic and a number of dice. Rikishi can try to influence the match tactic such that it matches their strongest skills (or the opponent's weaknesses).<br/><br/>After the basho the banzuke (ranking) is adjusted, rikishi age one year, and some retire (forcibly or voluntarily).<br/><br/>Playing one game year takes about 45 to 60 minutes, most of which is taken up by the tournament. Consequently, simulating a 10-year sumo career will take up to 10 hours. It is, however, easy to store away the game in between years, and thus to play the game in many different sessions spread out over a longer period of time.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 3.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Lajos Brons"], "categories": ["Dice", "Print & Play", "Sports"], "name": "Banzuke Shoushin", "playingtime": 600, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 6.5, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 6}, "106417": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 1, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1077771.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "trading": 0, "id": 106417, "yearpublished": 1920, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1077771_t.jpg", "publishers": ["John Jaques of London"], "families": [], "description": "Card game consisting of 52 cards featuring 5 sets of eight Citizen cards and four sets of three Vehicle Cards.<br/><br/>Shuffle them together then deal out an equal number of cards per player and everyone places their cards face-down in a pile in front of them.
