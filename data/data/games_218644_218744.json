Determined to finally win the war, Roman General Scipio Africanus led an invasion force into North Africa, the Carthaginian homeland. The opposing armies met near the town of Zama. Despite being outnumbered, the Romans were able to defeat the Carthaginians. With that victory the Romans had effectively won the war.<br/><br/>Zama is part of DG&rsquo;s Battles of the Ancient World series, that emphasizes simple but realistic design features to show critical aspects of classical era combat.

Counters represent the corps and armies of the war.

The players each choose a Strategy Card and an Addendum Card before each new season and may opt to play an additional card as a diplomatic response to certain events. These cards lead to new military units, leaders, and replacement steps and result in socio-economic and political events. The events include the declaration of Emancipation, the elections of 1862 and 1864, and the possible intervention by European nations.<br/><br/>Events are often double-edged swords, sometimes providing a military advantage while negatively affecting the popular will to fight. In addition, both sides may attempt to develop and manufacture new technologies, both historical and speculative, such as ironclads, submarines, torpedoes, observation balloons, repeating rifles and Gatling guns. Both sides can introduce espionage and even sabotage, which can have many unexpected consequences, including assassination. Scenarios are included for each year as well as the entire ACW.<br/><br/>Beyond the ACW proper, there are two introductory scenarios: Alamo, a mini-game of the War for Texas and Manifest Destiny, a Mexican-American War mini-game. These short campaigns will give new players an excellent place to start playing and veteran players will have two scenarios that can be finished in an evening. In addition there is Crisis &amp; Compromise, a card play oriented game of the period from the end of the Mexican-American War to the start of the Civil War. Though little combat occurs, the card play covers the actions inspiring events, leaders and regional positions (Border States)\u202fthat affect the allegiance of states to a region\u202fand the ability of military leaders at the start of the\u202fCivil War.

(SFW) is an alternative history wargame intended to investigate the strategic parameters that would&rsquo;ve been in place during the first 10 weeks of operations had that dictator lived long enough to put in motion his plan to start World War III in 1953. Had he lived, the most likely start date would&rsquo;ve been one closely coinciding with the signing of the Korean War armistice in July (in order to achieve a surprise effect).<br/><br/>His main goal in starting such a war wouldn&rsquo;t have been immediate global conquest; rather, in Europe he would&rsquo;ve been seeking to seize or thoroughly wreck the Ruhr &ndash; then, as now, one of the world&rsquo;s main industrial regions &ndash; or otherwise abort the still young Federal Republic of Germany (&ldquo;West Germany&rdquo;) as an effective member of the Western alliance. In Asia, the then already long-sought conquest of the Korean peninsula would&rsquo;ve been the objective, thereby putting Japan into what would&rsquo;ve amounted to a geo-strategic vice, given the USSR already possessed Sakhalin Island to its north.<br/><br/>There are atomic warfare rules, but their use by the Communist side is constrained by the limited availability of the bombs themselves, as well as by their historic lack at that time of a fully dependable means to deliver them. On the Allied (a.k.a. &ldquo;United Nations&rdquo; or &ldquo;UN&rdquo; or &ldquo;US&rdquo;) side, the limitation is a cultural one. That is, the early 1950s marked the full blown emergence of the anti-imperialist (a.k.a. &ldquo;hate America&rdquo; of &ldquo;third world&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-aligned&rdquo;) movement onto the global media stage. If, therefore, the Americans were to try to win the war by using enough a-bombs to simply blow to bits the attacking Communist hordes, they would do so much damage to the environmental and socio-political ecologies as to undo that battlefield victory in the broader grand-strategic sense.

In this game, players take the role of an ancient people who are attempting to develop by building monuments and colonizing or founding new cities in the Mediterranean sea.<br/><br/>The game is played in six rounds, each consisting of three phases: preparation, actions, and tidying up. There are three epochs &mdash; rounds 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 &mdash; with new monument cards entering the game at the beginning of rounds 1, 3 and 5. Each player has a personal player map with a time track for action markers and sand timer markers. In the action phase of a round, the players take their turns in clockwise order, conducting one action per turn. Each action requires an action marker from the main board that is placed on the time track. Depending on the information on the action marker, you have to also pay some money or take sand timers that are placed on the time track. When you have no free spaces on your time track, you must pass for the remainder of the round. Therefore, the number of actions per player in a single round may vary significantly if, for example, you choose double sand timers instead of two single ones or take action markers that require more money but fewer sand timers. Single sand timers are dropped in the tidying up phase, while double sand timers are flipped to become single sand timer markers and stay for another round. The actions are:<br/><br/><br/>    Buy new cards from the common display<br/>    Build monuments (playing cards from your hand to your personal display for victory points and new options)<br/>    Educate your people<br/>    Build/found cities<br/>    Take money<br/><br/><br/>To play a card, you must meet the requirements printed on that card, such as having specific persons on your personal board (e.g., two priests and four soldiers). These requirements are why eduction &mdash; i.e., getting specific people &mdash; is important, but that is not that easy because there are six different types of people &mdash; three on the left and three on the right side of your personal player board &mdash; and you have only six spaces in total for the two types in the same line. If you have three merchants, for example, you move your marker for counting merchants three spaces toward the side of the soldiers and thus you have only three spaces left for soldiers. By educating a fourth soldier and moving your soldier marker forward to its fourth space, you automatically lose one merchant because that marker is pushed back to its second space.<br/><br/>It is crucial to generate additional actions by using the specific functions of monuments in your display and cities you have built. Cities are expensive, but they create benefits at the end of each round or provide new options for taking an action without acquiring an action marker, gaining only a sand timer marker instead.<br/><br/>Try to have a steady income to avoid wasting actions to take money. Pay attention to the display of common cards, which is new in every single game, because the monument cards are shuffled randomly within the decks of epochs I, II and III. Collect identical symbols on the cards to benefit from the increasing victory points for a series of symbols.

Each bean card has a number that indicates how many cards of that type are in the deck, as well as a &quot;beanometer&quot; on the bottom of the card that tells you how many Talers you earn when you harvest those beans from your field. The more beans of a type that you have, the more Talers you earn.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player must plant the first card in hand into one of their fields, and they may plant the second card. All cards in a field must be of the same type. The player then reveals two cards from the deck and optionally trades those cards and cards in their hand with cards in the hands of other players; all traded cards must be planted, not returned to hand. Players can trade cards from anywhere in their hand, and doing so lets you set up good plays in future turns. To end a turn, a player draws cards and places them at the back of their hand. You can harvest a field at any time to collect Talers, keeping some cards to represent these coins and returning others to the discard pile to be recycled when the deck is shuffled.<br/><br/>Bohnanza: 20 Jahre adds one new type of bean to the game: the spring bean. Whenever a player harvests two spring beans, they draw cards from the deck equal to one more than the number of players. They plant one of these cards for themselves, then pass the cards around the table so that each other player can do the same. The final card is returned to the active player, who keeps it for a Taler.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Uwe Rosenberg"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Farming", "Negotiation"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Bohnanza: 20 Jahre", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 45, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 6.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 1}, "213167": {"mechanics": ["Deck / Pool Building", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "usersrated": 1, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3312593.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 213167, "yearpublished": 2017, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3312593_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Self-Published)"], "families": ["Admin: Unreleased Games"], "description": "Xtermination is a card game in which players clash between each other to survive in a post-apocalyptic world.<br/><br/>Players will choose between two different factions, Survivor and Infected, and will fight to rule the world using the characters and weapons at their disposal.

The men and women on the streets that have to deal with everything the city throws at them. In Gotham, with all those costumed characters around, that can be a lot!<br/><br/>One notable man in the GCPD is James 'Jim' Gordon. Even as a rookie cop, Gordon planned to remove all signs of corruption from the GCPD. As he rose through the ranks, he gained allies in the form of the Batman and Gothams then District Attorney, Harvey Dent to help him create an honest police department and clean up the city.<br/><br/>Gordon was the man to place the Bat Signal on the GCPD headquarters and while he was once secretive about working with Batman, he now openly uses the signal to call the Caped Crusader if needed.<br/><br/>Now, as Commissioner, Gordon tries to carry on the fight against crime and corruption from the top.<br/><br/>Even his daughter Barbara has joined the fight as the well know Batgirl.<br/><br/><br/>In the Batman Miniatures Game, the Law Forces are the normal men and women on the street trying to fight the madness around them.<br/><br/>Commissioner Gordon is now a Gotham Veteran. Leading teams of cops and SWAT against the criminals. Armed with his trusty gun and never leaving the precinct without a Kevlar Vest, Gordon can even call in the GCPD Air Support.<br/><br/>By his side you can often see Batgirl. While Jim doesn't like her living that life, he won't say no to her help. Able to get around the board with ease, Batgirl is great to send after anyone on rooftops or in hard to reach places.<br/><br/>The SWAT teams of the GCPD are some of the most well armed, trained and protected professionals in Gotham. Armed with battering rams, riot shields and a range of guns, the SWAT are the Elite force.<br/><br/>The street cops of Gotham also join the fight. While they carry less equipment that the SWAT, the Cops can arrest any criminals that have been taken out and light up any targets for the big guns in the dark streets and back alleys.<br/><br/>The GCPD don't often call on the help of Free Agents but will sometimes make unlikely alliances with those that aren't considered all bad, just misguided.<br/><br/>Catwoman and Mr Freeze can join along side the cops. Even if it's just to get to the Loot from the crimes they are stopping.<br/><br/>The Gotham City Police are great for those that want to take the normal people of Gotham and prove that costumes, capes and code names can still be stopped by anyone determined enough.<br/><br/>Contains:<br/>Four white metal miniatures (Jim Gordon and three SWAT Members - Alpha, Bravo, and Delta)<br/>Stat cards for the figures<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": [], "categories": ["Comic Book / Strip", "Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Batman Miniature Game: Commissioner Gordon & SWAT Team", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "213233": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling"], "usersrated": 1, "image": "", "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "trading": 0, "id": 213233, "yearpublished": 2016, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "", "publishers": ["Learning Resources"], "families": [], "description": "A roll-and-move game testing addition and subtraction facts, set on a board themed around the international space station.

This way if a full round (each player finishes an own turn) has finished a working day is simulated. Each three simulated days (which is called a Scrum Sprint) the players replan their work in a agile way.

Explorers will go through the jungle in search of &quot;Eldorado&quot;. They will enter villages, cross rivers and confront beasts and tribes that will try to ensure that their expedition does not end well.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with a character board, which indicates the initial abilities of this, as well as the life he has in each moment. He also receives a pawn of his color and a tent of his color.<br/>During the game, each player can find cards that help them improve their skills or increase their lives.<br/>The forest is represented by 73 tiles that are initially face down in the center of the table, we will turn them when we go exploring them, and a river that we must cross to go to the different zones of the forest.<br/>During the turn of each player can choose between three actions:<br/><br/>-Explore the jungle; He moves his pawn to an adjacent tile, and turns it face-up. Once you have seen the type of tile, you must steal a card from the corresponding deck and solve it with a dice roll, which depends on the skill you have.<br/><br/>-Recover territory explored; You can move your pawn by adjacent tiles from one to three, as long as they are scanned.<br/><br/>-Getting a camp; If your pawn has been placed in an abandoned camp tile, you can place your camp there by placing the tent of your color on this tile. You can change the location of your camp as many times as you want throughout the game. (This helps you when you contract a disease of the forest, since you must go to this camp to receive the treatment and to be able to continue playing)<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to be the explorer with more gold in his power when the game ends. The end of the game, occurs immediately when some explorer finds the mythical city of Eldorado, the player who finds it will receive a bonus of 10 gold coins.<br/>You will also receive a bonus of 4 gold coins, the most cursed explorer you have surpassed.<br/><br/>But beware, if a player is cursed when the game is over, he can not be a winner even if he is the one who has made the most money !!!

Tambi&eacute;n recibe un pe&oacute;n de su color y una tienda de campa&ntilde;a de su color.<br/>Durante la partida, cada jugador puede encontrar cartas, que le ayuden a mejorar sus habilidades o a incrementar sus vidas.<br/>La selva est&aacute; representada por 73 losetas que inicialmente est&aacute;n bocabajo en el centro de la mesa, las iremos girando cuando las vayamos explorando, y un r&iacute;o que debemos cruzar para ir a las diferentes zonas de la selva.<br/>Durante el turno de cada jugador puede elegir entre tres acciones:<br/><br/>-Explorar la jungla; Desplaza su pe&oacute;n a una loseta adyacente, y la vuelve boca arriba. Una vez visto el tipo de loseta, debe robar una carta del mazo correspondiente y resolverla mediante una tirada de dados, que depende de la habilidad que posea.<br/><br/>-Recorrer territorio explorado; Puedes desplazar tu pe&oacute;n por losetas adyacentes de una a tres, siempre y cuando est&eacute;n exploradas.<br/><br/>-Colocar un campamento; si tu pe&oacute;n se haya situado en una loseta de campamento abandonado, puedes situar all&iacute; tu campamento situando sobre esta loseta la tienda de campa&ntilde;a de tu color. Puedes cambiar la ubicaci&oacute;n de tu campamento tantas veces como quieras durante toda la partida. (Esto te ayuda cuando contraes una enfermedad de la selva, ya que deber&aacute;s ir a este campamento a recibir el tratamiento y poder seguir jugando)<br/><br/>El objetivo del juego es ser el explorador con m&aacute;s oro en su poder cuando la partida termine. El final de la partida, se produce inmediatamente cuando alg&uacute;n explorador encuentra la m&iacute;tica ciudad del Eldorado, el jugador que la encuentre recibir&aacute; una bonificaci&oacute;n de 10 monedas de oro.<br/>Tambi&eacute;n recibir&aacute; una bonificaci&oacute;n de 4 monedas de oro, el explorador que m&aacute;s maldiciones haya superado.<br/><br/>&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;Pero cuidado, si un jugador est&aacute; maldito cuando la partida acab&eacute;, no podr&aacute; ser ganador aunque sea el que m&aacute;s dinero haya conseguido!!!

Paradox Girl combines mechanics like those you might find in Chrononauts, Carcassonne, and Reversi to create a kind of battle-of-wits on an ever-changing board, which offers lots of chess-like tactical thinking in a more social atmosphere. Paradox Girl is streamlined enough to be welcoming and accessible to new gamers and all general audiences, but thought provoking and dynamic enough to engage more experienced and calculating gamers.<br/><br/>The game is played on a 4x4 grid of cards representing possible events along a timeline/continuum. Players represent different manifestations of the same character (since the gag is that Paradox Girl frequently crosses her own timeline and interacts/fights with herself). The object of the game is to score points for yourself or to deny points to your opponents by claiming and locking down event cards on the timeline with your pawns. Unlocked events and their point values are subject to be changed every turn when players &quot;change the future&quot; (deal new cards). Control of individual spaces/cards can be contested through a very light combat mechanic called a &quot;paradox brawl.&quot; Players can also accumulate secret bonus points by snagging Waffos (tokens), Paradox Girl's favorite brand of toaster-waffles.<br/> The game is based on characters created by Cayti Bourquin and appearing in &quot;Paradox Girl&quot; by Hanako Games/Hana Comics.

Put your 5 members against a zombie infested town with various zombie types.<br/><br/>Feeling historical. Let go WW2 with your British Commandos, Waffen SS, Japanese Para Marines, the US Airborne, Russians and Chinese.<br/><br/>Build a deck too and kit out your ops with various skills and equipment.<br/><br/>Each player takes 3 cards and places them onto each Commandos dash board but keep them secret from the other players. Example of cards are tactics and equipment e.g. Kill box tactic, which means your unit will open fire on the first enemy unit to cross his line of sight. Kill box is used in the enemies turn meaning the enemy player has the risk of being shot at as he does not know if your unit as the kill box card.  Another example is grenades. Your unit could be carrying a smoke grenade and HE grenade on top of their standard equipment. A standard CQB operator for say comes with a SMG and shotgun plus a flash bang and grenade. So you could kit him up with extra grenades or medi packs etc with the extra equipment cards.<br/><br/>The game is played with a D12 (12 sided dice).  Each unit in the attackers turn has 5 actions each and the player uses them how he wants eg move, shot, reload, use rocket launcher etc. Some actions like rocket launcher cost 2 actions.  The defending player also get to use actions in their turn but only 3 and only if shot at or attacked.  Example if your shotgunner fires and hit or misses, the defender gets options. The defender can shot back, run, run and shot or charge. Each option has various negative and more negatives if your unit happened to be hit. Running for say means he can run to cover if in range as each member can only move 3-4-5 inches per action depending on their equipment load. If running then the attacker can choose to shot again but at -1 accuracy to the roll. The defender can use 1 action up to 3 action per defence turn. If he is attacked a 4th time then he can do nothing about it.<br/><br/>Each unit has 10 wounds unless the have the skill Airborne which gives them 11 wounds. Face shots take off 2 wounds. Being hit in the arm twice will decrease accuracy. Legs 2 twice decreases movement. Having only 1 wound left means your unit can only crawl and lay.  Laying down or kneeing however increases your defence meaning the attacker has -1 or -2 to his accuracy when rolling to hit.  Medi packs increases wounds by 2.<br/><br/>Reloading is required for every 3 shots and cost 1 action. Changing weapons like taking out a pistol cost 1 action unless you have the transition skill meaning it costs nothing to swap weapons.<br/><br/>The game is highly tactical and there are various distances for weapons. Point blank. Close range. Short range. Medium. Long and extreme. Some weapons can not shot into long and extreme like shot guns etc.<br/><br/>Standard mission is kill the enemy team.<br/>Embassy siege is an Expansion which gives you 20 bad guys and hostages. Basically rescue the hostages. You can also play this as bank robbery too or town take over. Kill the bad guys.<br/><br/>Zombie is another Expansion. 3 missions.

Will you add some British Red Coats, or Musketeers to name a few.<br/><br/>With extra units coming too like the rock throwing Trebuchet, Valkyries, Geisha assassins, Bees nest rocket arrows etc.<br/><br/>Commands powerful Heroes like Thor or Arch Angel Michael or military strategists like Julius Caesar or Sun Tzu.<br/><br/>28mm miniatures<br/><br/>Each unit counts as a large squad with a certain amount of health. Each unit as 3 attack statistics and 3 defense. Martial counts as a units attack speed (how fast they can use their sword). Strength is how powerful your soldier or weapon is. Aggression is how many times your unit can attack per turn so your unit may strike 3 times with a strength of 1 totaling 3 damage. However for defence they enemy unit has agility meaning they may be able to avoid all or some attacks. Toughness may decrease an attacker strength meaning a strength 5 attack against heavy armour toughness 3 possibly equals only receiving 2 damage. The defenders may even attack first if their martial is higher than the attacking units. So attacking someone like Thor wouldn't be wise in close combat has he would likely attack first and with great strength and aggression.<br/><br/>Ranged weapons has 3 stats.  Accuracy.

Rain is mostly for arrows, like a hailstorm of arrows raining down and meteor is for things like big rocks.<br/><br/>You don't roll to hit instead once your within melee range you see who hits first (martial) then calculate how many attacks and some strength minis the defenders agility and toughness.<br/><br/>Melee can change also depending on the formation your units are in. Declare which formation your using and place the formation token next to your unit. The defender also has a chance to change formation depending on how far they are from you and their leadership command skill. Example an arrow head formation from cavalry would decimate a unit of Axe men in a standard line formation. You add the formation score of the successful formation charge to the score of your attack. So attacks in melee for say is 6 damage plus 2 damage for the formation charge totaling 8 damage.<br/><br/>As you units health decrease so does the amount of attack you can perform for that unit.  a unit with 10 health at aggression 2 = 20 attacks.  if your unit has decreased to health 5 then the total attacks is 10 because have your squad is dead.

Reach is like spears and pike.  An axe men unit would be hit first by Pikemen even if the Axemen have a higher Martial because the Pikemen have big long spear.

Spear are Reach 2 and Pike are 3 inch hit.<br/><br/>20% of your army can be made up from mercenary units from another army.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game you also have a certain amount of points to spend on upgrades like flaming arrows, smoke bombs, traps and flaming logs etc.  You can buy oil and place it on the battlefield then Use your flaming arrows to light it up.

In 1870, Otto von Bismarck expertly played on a millennia of tension to orchestrate the Franco-Prussian War that led to a unified German state, and the dissolution of the Second Empire of Napoleon III. This resurgent (and increasingly belligerent) Germany sent diplomatic shock-waves throughout Europe, setting the stage for the Great War, which saw pickle-helmed German troops invade the West in 1914. Resentment over the eventual Allied victory paved the way for the rise of Nazi Germany, which pointed its panzers toward Paris in 1940, delivering a crushing and humiliating defeat to France and its allies.<br/><br/>Each of these conflicts saw France invaded by Germany, and resulted in a desperate, bloody struggle. In what other ways were these conflicts similar? How were they different? Why did they turn out the way that they did?<br/><br/>Teutons!: Assaults on the West, 1870-1940 seeks to answer these questions by simulating these three conflicts utilizing a common basic ruleset and map, with modifications specific to that era and conflict. Each Unit represents an Army or Corps, and each hex represents 35 kilometers. This keeps the counter density fairly low, and the playtime reasonable. The game uses a Move-Combat sequence and odds-based CRT, and allows for some flexibility when resolving Combat. In the 1914 and 1940 games, the German Player has a special Breakthrough (exploitation) phase. These familiar mechanisms are further enhanced by clever bits of chrome, from the amorous misadventures of Mata Hari to the Miracle at Dunirk. It's an ideal introductory wargame - or rather, three ideal introductory wargames in a single box.<br/><br/>For years, designer Lou Coatney has been designing simple, fun hex-and-counter wargames which he has released for free download on his website. For some gamers - including Hollandspiele co-founder Tom Russell - Mr. Coatney's designs were the first wargames they ever got onto the table.

An Allied force made up of French, British, and Turks had laid siege to the major naval port of Sevastopol.  Desperate to lift the siege, their Russian enemies probed the allied line for a weak spot. They found it on Mount Inkerman, held by less than 7,000 British. On October 27, the Russians initiated a brief skirmish to test the British defenses (later called &quot;Little Inkerman&quot;). On November 5, they were ready to crush them with over 35,000 Russians.<br/><br/>It did not go quite as planned. The disorganized Russians had their forces divided in two parts, under the command of three generals, each of whom had a different, contradictory, battle plan. A cold and dense fog allowed the Russians to get the drop on their enemies, but visibility was so poor that there was little command structure in place for either side. Regiments and companies had no choice but to fight (or flee) on their own initiative, giving Inkerman the nickname &quot;the Soldier's Battle&quot;.<br/><br/>While the fog reduced the range of the Allied Mini&eacute; rifle, it was far more accurate and deadly than the Russian muskets, especially at point-blank range. The Russians relied on ferocious but bloody bayonet charges to make up the difference. But as Russian morale started to flag, the fog began to lift, and nearly 9,000 Allied reinforcements arrived-- particularly the fearsome French Zouaves-- the battle turned in the Allied favor. In the end, there were 4,676 Allied killed and wounded, and over 10,000 Russian.<br/><br/>The game uses a unique variant on chit-pull activation mechanisms, with each player alternating pulling from their own pool. The number of activations per turn is tied to the current Fog level. At the start of the game, it's somewhat difficult for the Fog to rise, but once it starts to do so, it happens rapidly. Russian morale is simulated via its own chit-pull pool, and like the Fog, it begins the game in solid shape but once it starts to flag, it quickly collapses. In this way, the odds start to shift to favor the Allied Player. Generally speaking, the Russian Player is strong in the early game and his opponent in the late game.<br/><br/>Step-losses and the gradual erosion of fighting strength is modeled using the &quot;stack of steps&quot; mechanic featured in some earlier Tom Russell designs, such as 2012's Blood on the Alma.

On a turn, a player lays a card from their and onto one of the cards in the square, then sums that card and the two adjacent cards, stating this number and the color of all non-grey cards out loud, e.g., &quot;13 in purple and yellow&quot;. Each player can then write a 13 in either the purple or yellow row on their score sheet.

Roberts Award-winning game Downtown. Red Storm is a standalone game that utilizes the Downtown game system to depict a hypothetical air war in May/June 1987 over the central portion of the NATO/Warsaw Pact front in central Germany.  Like Downtown and Elusive Victory before it, Red Storm is an &ldquo;operational&rdquo; level air warfare game where players manage large strike packages and numerous combat air patrols in an effort to strike enemy targets, protect their own ground troops, and secure control of the air over the land battle raging below.  Both sides have highly advanced all-weather aircraft, long-range missiles, precision bombs, sophisticated electronic warfare assets, and dense air defense networks of surface-to-air missiles and radar-guided AAA.<br/><br/>As the NATO player, you fight outnumbered in the air, but with a qualitative edge in technology and better-trained pilots.  NATO faces the daunting task of contesting the air in the face of the initial onslaught from the WP air forces while also getting bombs onto targets on the ground both on the frontline and rear echelon forces of the Soviet and East German armies.  As the Warsaw Pact player,  you must push your numerous but less flexible forces to the absolute limit in an effort to overwhelm NATO forces in the air and destroy them on the ground, all while supporting advancing ground forces.  Both players also have to manage their air defense networks consisting of overlapping layers of SAM and AAA.<br/><br/>Units<br/>Like earlier games in the series, units in Red Storm are flights of 1 to 4 aircraft, each tasked with different roles such as bombing, combat air patrol, close escort, or jamming support.  Red Storm features more than 50 types of aircraft, including both older &ldquo;3rd Generation&rdquo; workhorses like the F-4E Phantom II and MiG-23 Flogger as well as advanced &ldquo;4th Generation&rdquo; fighters including the US F-15 Eagle, the UK/West German Tornado, and the Soviet MiG-29 Fulcrum. Aircraft from the air forces of Belgium, West Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and East Germany are provided.  Ground units depict various types of troop concentrations, SAMs, and AAA assets.  The SAM network on both sides is both more numerous and more dangerous than ever, with low-altitude SAMs like the UK Rapier, US Chaparral, and Soviet SA-13 Gopher joining a daunting array of medium/high altitude SAMs like the US Patriot and Soviet SA-10.<br/><br/>Maps and Terrain<br/>Two 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map sheets depict the rough terrain in the central portion of the NATO front line, reaching from the Rhine river in the west to the Thuringia region of southwest East Germany.  The map uses the same scale of approximately 2.5 nautical miles per hex used in earlier games in the series.  This densely populated region of Europe features numerous rivers, cities, and airfields dot the map.  Unlike earlier games in the series, Red Storm features a frontline that moves steadily west as the Warsaw Pact armies advance.<br/><br/>Game System<br/>Like the earlier games in the series, Red Storm requires both players to do planning for both their air and ground forces prior to a scenario.  Raid forces must be generated, targets and routes planned, and aircraft loadouts determined.  SAM, AAA, and radar units must be placed to take advantage of the rough terrain and frequently poor weather of central Germany.<br/><br/>During a scenario, players go through a sequence of phases each turn where they conduct electronic warfare, use various means to detect and track enemy flights, and move and fight with their flights while potentially being attacked from the ground.  The heart of game is the movement phase where players use a chit-draw system that allows players to alternate moving one to five flights at a time.<br/><br/>Scenarios<br/>The war depicted in Red Storm is a short one, with just six weeks between the start of the air war and a fateful initiation of nuclear warfare by both sides.  More than 20 scenarios feature a mix of day and night operational missions for both sides, including missions to directly support frontline ground troops as well as many missions that &ldquo;go deep&rdquo; behind enemy lines to strike enemy airfields, logistics, and air defense networks.  These range in size from smaller, partial-map ones that can be played in an afternoon to very large, full-map scenarios that might take a couple of days to complete.  There are also scenarios depicting reconnaissance missions, airborne drops, helicopter assaults, special forces insertions, cruise missile strikes, and delivery of nuclear weapons.<br/><br/>Components<br/>Two 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; maps<br/>1,260 die cut counters<br/>One Rules Booklet<br/>One Scenario Booklet<br/>Four Full-Color Player Aid Cards<br/>Four Full-Color Aircraft Data Cards<br/>Two 10-sided dice<br/>NATO and Warsaw Pact log sheets<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Douglas Bush"], "categories": ["Aviation / Flight", "Modern Warfare", "Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Red Storm: The Air War Over Central Germany, 1987", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 240, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 8.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 1}, "213498": {"mechanics": ["Player Elimination", "Press Your Luck", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3267410.png", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 213498, "yearpublished": 2016, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3267410_t.png", "publishers": ["(Web published)"], "families": [], "description": "Description from the designer:<br/><br/>Steampunk Admirals is a skirmish card game where two people duel in steampunked WWI ironclads.

Its four distinctive miniatures, each of which comes with its corresponding unit tile, allow you to push the heroes to their limits with powerful spells and precision strikes.<br/><br/>As a powerful spell caster, the sorcerous Shubba can loose your vengeance upon the heroes with any spells you give him, and his concentration ability ensures that he'll never find his spell casting hindered by the heroes' interference.<br/><br/>Shubba's allies, Shafiah and Ghayoor, are skilled warriors whose attacks of two orange dice are deadlier than the heroes might expect. This is because they both have the precision strike ability which effectively allows their attacks to ignore the first point of a hero's armor. Meanwhile, their loyalty to the sorcerer is unquestionable, as both are willing to sacrifice themselves in his defense, if such a sacrifice should ever prove necessary.<br/><br/>The deadliest of the expansion's three melee warriors, Afari pairs his solid defense and brutal attack with the ability to counterattack. Whenever he faces one of the heroes' melee attacks, Afari can immediately retaliate by attacking with a single red die.

With a little concentration and some good luck &ndash; here as in reality the risks may be reduced and possibilitis of profit increased.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Players engage as a ship's master and take turns to roll two dices to move their ship along different paths in the mediterranean. Each player must aquire 5000 tons of cargo divided into five different goods (1000 tons each) from the harbours around the mediterranean. Players also sail during different seasons of the year and the goods requirement will differ (e.g. one player needs raisins, oranges, nuts, cotton, and tobaco while others need other goods). The types of goods are spread out at different ports and as only half of the requirement for each product can be loaded at the same port, the players will need to visit more than five ports to fulfill their requirements (with some exceptions). The game becomes a task of route optimization to visit the neccessary ports with the least number of dice rolls. Along the way sailors run the risk of encountering storms, price changes on the goods exchange, and random events received via telegram. When all goods have been aquired the players must sail back to Sweden and sell the cargo in Gothenburg and Stockholm (half in each) according to current prices on the goods exchange.

Each one of them has a unique set of traits: movement, attack power, abilities, etc. At the beginning of a game, the player will configure the abilities the hero will be able to use during the fight: these abilities will make the hero more defensive, capable of helping other heroes and/or having access to powerful attacks.<br/><br/>The y\u014dkai are the enemies of the game: inspired in the ones from the Japanese folklore, these supernatural beings will follow &ldquo;behavior cards&rdquo;, so their acting is managed by the own players. Those will indicate in an easy to follow way what the y\u014dkai will do in each given situation. The y\u014dkai will be constantly spawning from settled points in random amounts, decided by drawing cards from their specific deck.<br/><br/>Heroes and Y\u014dkai take turns to play: they will move, attack and use abilities while fighting in the tiled boards. The gameplay has a staged feeling, represented by the different scenarios.

Oshi Castle, a stronghold of the Narita clan, was besieged by forces loyal to the Toyotomi clan. The castle was famously defended for over a month by a force consisting of only 619 samurai and 2000 local conscripts against forces numbering over 20,000. The battle is also famous for the actions of Lady Kai (\u7532\u6590\u59eb / Kaihime), who led 200 Narita men into battle to rout the initial attack against the castle.<br/><br/>The game incorporates standard hex-and-counter movement on a map representing the region around the castle. The game proceeds in an &quot;IGO-UGO&quot; manner. Units may perform ranged fire in an attempt to cause enemy units to become disordered (recovery from disorder may be attempted at the beginning of each turn). Enemy units may also return fire to cause disorder on their attackers. Close combat proceeds on a simplified, odds-based combat resolution table using a single die (d6), and can result in disorder, losses and retreat. If an army suffers enough losses, it becomes demoralized, suffering combat penalties and the elimination of any unit that becomes disordered. The game includes special rules for Lady Kai's ability to boost the morale of conscript units under her.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>A4 map (210mm &times; 297mm / 8.3&quot; &times; 11.7&quot;)<br/>50 mounted, back-printed counters (not die-cut)<br/>A5 rulebook: two pages historical notes, four pages &quot;Warring States Folio&quot; series rules, two pages game-specific rules<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["Medieval", "Wargame"], "name": "Oshi-j\u014d no tatakai (\u5fcd\u57ce\u306e\u6226\u3044)", "playingtime": 120, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "213646": {"mechanics": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Card Drafting", "Worker Placement"], "usersrated": 1, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3309908.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "trading": 0, "id": 213646, "yearpublished": 2017, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3309908_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Golden Ratio Games"], "families": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Before the planets, before the stars&hellip;<br/>Before the galaxies, before the universe&hellip;<br/>Before time began&hellip;<br/>Incomprehensibly powerful sentiences sought to dominate the preconceptual chaos of their existence and annihilate those that opposed their will.<br/>To the victor, the ultimate prize: creation itself.<br/><br/>In Elementa, each player takes the role of one of these sentiences, aiming to defeat their opponent to ensure they are free to shape a universe to their own design.

Conflict between elementals may encourage one side to end hostilities and rethink their strategy in a new round, but the battle of wills is not infinite and it is only the player who succeeds at the pre-defined end of the contest that is victorious.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Geoff Greenwood", "Lucy Greenwood"], "categories": ["Fantasy", "Science Fiction"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Elementa", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 90, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 10.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 1}, "213647": {"mechanics": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "usersrated": 1, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3270492.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 213647, "yearpublished": 1980, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3270492_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Estrela"], "families": [], "description": "Roll a die to move one of your 3 hand pieces and steal other players coins.

What is unique about SPac is the smaller map region (see c3i 30 back cover image) focuses and significantly simplifies the strategic options available to the two sides.<br/><br/>Each side has a 24 card deck that are like the EotS cards except they have been renumbered. The counter mix is also identical, except we have aligned the set up and reinforcement markings to the four-turn scenario. In designing this new C3i Scenario Variant, I wanted to put you in the shoes of MacArthur and Ghormley/Halsey prosecuting the US counterattack, while still being impacted by interservice rivalry, China, and competition for resources in Europe. All of the relevant tracks have been redesigned by Mark Simonitch to fit on the tailored C3i Mapsheet surface that shines a spotlight on the turning point in the Pacific War.<br/><br/>Since this is a subset of the broader war each player is playing with a four rather than a seven card hand, and you will never reshuffle the deck allowing for high replayability. The practical result of this smaller hand of cards is South Pacific typically clocks in at less than two hours, so easily a one-session game.<br/><br/>If you learn to how to play South Pacific you will also know how to play its parent game Empire of the Sun.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 3.5, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Mark Herman"], "categories": ["Nautical", "Wargame", "World War II"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "South Pacific: Breaking the Bismarck Barrier 1942-1943", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 120, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 8.16667, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.897527, "numcomments": 17}, "217752": {"mechanics": ["Modular Board", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "usersrated": 2, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3368162.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 3, "trading": 0, "id": 217752, "yearpublished": 2016, "maxplayers": 1, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3368162_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Self-Published)", "(Web published)"], "families": [], "description": "Description from the designer:<br/><br/>In these days of recession, it's not that easy to scrape an honest living.

Unfortunately that day was about 100 years ago and mowing with it now is tricky, due to the machine&rsquo;s somewhat limited functions.<br/>Mind you don't smash it into those trees, because it'll cost you for repairs and watch out for that dog. Above all try to steer clear of the customers' flower beds and prize vegetables as they get very upset at the sight of beheaded daffodils or mashed marrow.<br/><br/>Mower Mania is a mix of puzzle/strategy (working out best routes through the gardens), resource management (your mower functions) and luck (dice for movement and randomness of garden tile layout).<br/><br/>When you land on a long grass tile, you turn it over to reveal it nicely mowed. Landing on vegetables or flowers, however, results in loss of points (money). Land on a pot, or go too fast into a tree or garden feature, and you'll also sustain damage to your mower.<br/><br/>The amount you earn will be based on how much of the lawn you've successfully mowed (a minimum amount required to progress to the next garden) and how much damage you've caused. You'll then need to pay for mower repairs and to replenish mower functions you used.<br/>.<br/><br/>Mower Mania was an entry in the 2016 Mint Tin Design Contest and did exceptionally well:<br/><br/>1st place: Best Overall Design<br/>1st place: Best Theme<br/>2nd place: Best Artwork &amp; Graphic Design<br/>3rd place: Best Written Rules<br/>Top pick: of Guest Judge, Caroline Berg <br/>.<br/><br/>Thanks to all those at BoardgameGeek who played the game, and gave feedback and suggestions, during the contest, especially:<br/>John Kean, lelo Arrowsmith.

This game has two blank cards so that players may name two sides by their preference, such as pro-Brexit and anti-Brexit, cat person and dog person.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>\u4eca\u3053\u306e\u56fd\u306f\u300c\u541b\u4e3b\u5236\u6d3e\u300d\u3068\u300c\u5171\u548c\u5236\u6d3e\u300d\u306b\u5206\u304b\u308c\u3066\u4e89\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u72b6\u6cc1\u3067\u3059\u3002(\u3053\u308c\u306f\u8aac\u660e\u306e\u70ba\u3067\u3059\u3002\u5b9f\u969b\u306f\u300c\u96e2\u8131\u6d3e\u30fb\u6b8b\u7559\u6d3e\u300d\u300c\u72ac\u6d3e\u30fb\u732b\u6d3e\u300d\u7b49\u3001\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u3082\u306e\u306b\u3057\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044)<br/>\u30fb\u300c\u6709\u529b\u8005\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u300d\u306f1\u301c20\u306e\u6570\u5b57\u304c\u632f\u3063\u3066\u3042\u308a\u30011\u304c\u5171\u548c\u5236\u6d3e\u306e\u6700\u6709\u529b\u8005\u300120\u304c\u541b\u4e3b\u5236\u6d3e\u306e\u6700\u6709\u529b\u8005\u3068\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u30fb\u300c\u5171\u548c\u5236\u6d3e\u300d\u306f1\u306b\u8fd1\u3044\u65b9\u304c\u3088\u308a\u5f37\u529b\u306a\u6709\u529b\u8005\u3067\u3059\u306e\u3067\u3001\u5171\u548c\u5236\u6d3e\u304c\u5b9f\u6a29\u3092\u63e1\u308c\u3070\u300120\u306f\u6700\u5f31\u3068\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u30fb\u300c\u541b\u4e3b\u5236\u6d3e\u300d\u306f20\u306b\u8fd1\u3044\u65b9\u304c\u3088\u308a\u5f37\u529b\u306a\u6709\u529b\u8005\u3067\u3059\u306e\u3067\u3001\u541b\u4e3b\u5236\u6d3e\u304c\u5b9f\u6a29\u3092\u63e1\u308c\u3070\u30011\u306f\u6700\u5f31\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u30fb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u958b\u59cb\u6642\u306b\u914d\u3089\u308c\u305f\u300c\u6709\u529b\u8005\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u300d\u3092\u898b\u3066\u3001\u3069\u3061\u3089\u5074\u306e\u6709\u529b\u8005\u3068\u7e4b\u304c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304b\u3092\u78ba\u8a8d\u3057\u3066\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u30fb\u3069\u3061\u3089\u304b\u306e\u9663\u55b6\u306b\u300c\u6570\u5b57\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u300d\u3092\u88cf\u5411\u304d\u3067\u7f6e\u304f\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3001\u305d\u306e\u9663\u55b6\u3092\u652f\u63f4\uff08\u6295\u7968\u3057\u305f\u3068\u8003\u3048\u308b\u3068\u5206\u304b\u308a\u3084\u3059\u3044\u304b\u3082\u77e5\u308c\u307e\u305b\u3093\uff09\u3092\u3057\u3066\u3044\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u30fb\u5168\u54e1\u306e\u3059\u3079\u3066\u306e\u624b\u672d\u304c\u306a\u304f\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3089\u3001\u300c\u6570\u5b57\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u300d\u3092\u96c6\u8a08\u3057\u3066\u5408\u8a08\u304c\u591a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u9663\u55b6\u304c\u5b9f\u6a29\u3092\u63e1\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u30fb\u300c\u5b9f\u6a29\u3092\u63e1\u3063\u305f\u5074\u306e\u6709\u529b\u8005\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u300d\u3067\u6700\u3082\u6709\u529b\u306a\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u304c\u52dd\u5229\u3067\u3059\u3002<br/>\u30fb\u4f8b\u3048\u3070\u300c\u541b\u4e3b\u5236\u6d3e\u300d\u304c\u5b9f\u6a29\u3092\u63e1\u3063\u305f\u5834\u5408\u306f\u300120\u306b\u8fd1\u3044\u6709\u529b\u8005\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u52dd\u5229\u3068\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u30fb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u5909\u5316\u3092\u6301\u305f\u305b\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3001\u300c\u30ea\u30e0\u30fc\u30d6\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u300d\u3068\u300c\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30ea\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\uff08\u978d\u66ff\u3048\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\uff09\u300d\u304c\u7528\u610f\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Siberia (\u30b7\u30d9\u30ea\u30a2)"], "categories": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Memory", "Party Game"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Tenbin ni Kakero (\u5929\u79e4\u306b\u304b\u3051\u308d)", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "217799": {"mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Memory"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 217799, "yearpublished": 2016, "maxplayers": 7, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "", "publishers": ["Siberia (\u30b7\u30d9\u30ea\u30a2)"], "families": [], "description": "User summary<br/>\u5149\u3068\u95c7\u3068 (Hikari to Yami to) in English is 'Light &amp; Darkness'.<br/><br/>In the game of Hikari to Yami to, players play cards to score points, and the highest scorer wins the game.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, players have the same number of cards.

The rule book credits Douglas Lawson for having &quot;correlated&quot; the Babcock rules with card play.<br/><br/>The 164-card deck replicates the mix of tiles in the classic game. It includes four cards for 1-9 for each of the three suits (Dots, Bamboo, Characters), as well as four each of the North, South, East and West winds and Red, Green and White Dragons, plus the 8 Flower cards. As in the classic rules, players try to collect sets or 3 or 4 of a kind or in a sequence, with bonuses for various combinations and special tiles.<br/><br/>Instead of ivory or bone scoring sticks, the card game uses thin colored wooden rods for scoring. The game includes 40 short green sticks worth 2 each, 32 medium-length yellow sticks worth 10, 36 longer red sticks worth 100, and 8 long blue sticks worth 500.<br/><br/>While the rule book focuses on the Standard and Royal games for four players, it does include variant rules for 3, 5 and 6 players.

Their hope was to destroy the southern wing of the German army while it was still reeling from its defeat at Stalingrad. There were large gaps in the German lines and a quick advance here could turn the tide of the war. Time after time the Panzergrenadier Division Grossdeutschland was called upon to reinforce, fill and stabilize weak points, and to close the gaps before the onslaught of Soviet troops could pour through. Oftentimes they were outnumbered and arrived just in the nick of time. As the front stabilized they were called upon again to spearhead the German drives against the Soviet 40th and 69th Armies.<br/><br/>The Soviets made several coordinated attacks during these months, one including Operation Star (February 2-19). During this offensive the Soviets took Belgorod and Kharkov. On the German side Manstein initiated his &quot;Backhand Blow&quot; on February 20. These battles went on through March 5 and beyond. Kharkov was taken back by the Germans in March during this push. Further German advances set up the upcoming summer&rsquo;s battle for Kursk.<br/><br/>The areas around and cities of Belgorod and Kharkov were key points in many of the battles above. Both cities were major transportation hubs and control of the roads between them was critical to both the Soviets and the Germans. Advancing, reinforcements and supply was dependent upon whoever controlled these cities. By the end of February the Soviets were pushing the limits of their endurance and were very near the end of their supply lines. The Germans needed these same cities to stop the enemy advance, form a semblance of a solid line, and prepare for the inevitable counterattacks. Fierce battles raged on and on with many villages and hills along the path changing hands multiple times. Each side's positions for the summer of 1943 campaigns were now at stake.<br/><br/>In this expansion for Fighting Formations we feature the Grossdeutschland Division as it fought in 1943 and early 1944 around the Ukrainian city of Kharkov. In each scenario, one player will take command of elements of this elite German formation while the other assumes control of the opposing forces of the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>Fighting Formations: Grossdeutschland Division's Battle for Kharkov expands upon the original Fighting Formations game by taking the Grossdeutschland Division into 1943 and the winter of 1944. This expansion features ten new scenarios, many using new units for the German and Soviet sides, played on ten new maps.<br/><br/>The new Battle for Kharkov playbook includes the following:<br/><br/>&bull; 10 new scenarios, including many smaller and shorter engagements<br/>&bull; Updated order of battle for GD, encompassing units and hardware added in 1943<br/>&bull; Historical notes covering GD&rsquo;s fighting in the Ukraine<br/><br/>In addition to the new playbook, the game includes 3 large and 2 small back-printed game maps (10 maps total), and a half-sized counter sheet containing new pieces for both the German and Soviet arsenals. New units include:<br/><br/>&bull; The Soviet SU-76M &ldquo;Suka&rdquo; open-topped assault gun;<br/>&bull; SU-85 tank destroyer;<br/>&bull; T-34C;<br/>&bull; T-26b light tank;<br/>&bull; The German Mk VI Tiger I<br/>&bull; PzIII M;<br/>&bull; 7.5cm PaK 40 anti-tank gun;<br/>&bull; Low quality troops representing GD artillerymen forced to fight on the front lines<br/><br/>The new scenarios included in Battle for Kharkov are:<br/><br/>&bull; Cut Off&mdash;Units of the Grossdeutschland Regiment find themselves surrounded by advancing Soviet forces on the highway leading north to Belgorod on 11 February 1943.<br/><br/>&bull; Who&rsquo;s Who&mdash;On 4 November 1943 near Krasny Orlik, Major Frantz, the Assault Gun Battalion commander, became quite wary when he heard the sounds of combat to his north. This northern flank was to be held by 9th Panzer. However, nothing could be seen over the high rail line that divided their two sections of the front. Were they still there and holding the line? Major Frantz decided to investigate the situation for himself and crossed the rail line with another assault gun. As he watched German troops and guns stream by in retreat he found himself in the midst of a tall cornfield with Russian T-34s streaming by at a range of 20 yards. They were faster than he was, and were by him in an instant&hellip;.<br/><br/>&bull; Duel&mdash;General Koniev's 2nd Ukrainian Front launched a major offensive in December of 1943, with the aim to break through the German lines in the Kirovograd area. Multiple attacks were launched and Soviet troops were pouring through. The Panzergrenadier Grossdeutschland Division was brought up to close the gaps and help create a continuous defensive line. There was a critically vulnerable point along the road to the east of the village of Anniska. Here II Battalion, Panzergrenadier Regiment GD was struggling to hold its position. They were reinforced by the anti-aircraft troops of GD's Army FlaK Battalion just in the nick of time.<br/><br/>&bull; Welcome to Kharkov&mdash;21 January 1943: Reports from the Soviet Voronezh Front were that they had broken through the Hungarian army's positions and were advancing into the Novy Oskol area northwest of Kharkov. The Oskol river was being breached and preparations were in progress for further attacks towards Belgorod and Kharkov. General Kazakov's 69th Army was to attack southeast taking Volchansk and then on into Kharkov. Before the city, however, lay Volokonovka, which would provide an opportunity to hit the German's defensive line and test their resolve. Were the German forces finally weakening?<br/><br/>&bull; Charge&mdash;9 March 1943: The 3rd Squadron of &ldquo;Battle Group Strachwitz,&rdquo; after taking fire from nearby Alexandrovka, was assigned the job of taking out the Soviet forces there. Rather than wait, they immediately charged down the slopes into the heavy defensive fire coming directly at them.<br/><br/>&bull; Can We Hold?&mdash;March 17 started out quietly, but it was not to stay that way. The II Battalion of the Grenadier Regiment was sent into Borisovka to free up other GD units for attacking elsewhere. The relieved units left mid-morning. In the late afternoon about a dozen Soviet tanks and infantry charged in from the northeast, broke through the outer line, and drove directly into the village.<br/><br/>&bull; Overrun&mdash;18 February 1943: Kharkov had just fallen to the Soviets and a realignment of the German defensive line was formed to its south. The Grossdeutschland Division's Fusilier Regiment was given the assignment of defending a section of road leading to the west out of Kharkov towards Ljubotin. Rybalko's Soviet 3rd Tank Army was trying to break through this new line southwest of the city. One of his attacks took place on the outskirts of the town of Korotich near a collective farm.<br/><br/>&bull; Just in Time&mdash;The Soviet Voronezh Front had three armies poised to attack towards Kharkov in early February &lsquo;43 as part of Operation Star. Their forces had taken the city of Belgorod as this progressed and they were continuing to push southward to achieve their goal. Delaying actions to slow the advance was all the Germans were capable of at this point in time. The Soviet 40th Army was now northeast of Kharkov and was trying to find a seam between SS Reich units and the Grossdeutschland Division defending outside of Veseloye. They were looking for easy openings in the German line that could be taken advantage of and thus move down the Belgorod-Kharkov highway and into Kharkov itself. Grossdeutschland's reinforced Fusilier Regiment was in the direct line of this advance....<br/><br/>&bull; A Change of Orders&mdash;The Soviets 2nd Ukrainian Front launched a major offensive in late December of 1943 in southern Russia. The attacks began in earnest on 5 January 1944 with the goal of breaking through the German lines in the Kirovograd area. These caused multiple gaps in the German lines. On the evening of January 7 Grossdeutschland units were close at hand and were called upon to help remedy the tenuous situation.<br/><br/>&bull; Tigers&mdash;In early March &lsquo;43 the momentum in the area around the city of Kharkov was turning towards the Germans. Manstein's counterattack was pushing the Soviets back and gaining ground on all sides. Gaps were developing between the Soviet 40th and 69th Armies. On March 4 Grossdeutschland Division received its first Tiger tank company. Three days later GD jumped off, attacking towards Bogodukhov to the northwest of Kharkov.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Chad Jensen"], "categories": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Wargame", "World War II"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Fighting Formations: Grossdeutschland Division's Battle for Kharkov", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 270, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 1}, "213803": {"mechanics": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Dice Rolling", "Point to Point Movement", "Variable Player Powers"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3300088.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 213803, "yearpublished": 2016, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3300088_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Warlord Games"], "families": [], "description": "March 1947.

War becomes unavoidable. <br/><br/>The Prussian army concentrates on Erf&uuml;rt without waiting for the troops of its Russian ally. Outrunning his opponents, Napoleon enters Saxony with the Grand Army on October 7, 1806 and heads for Berlin.<br/><br/>A week later the Prussians, defeated at Jena and Auerstaedt, retreat North. The pursuit led by the Murat cavalry can begin... <br/><br/>When the game meets history:<br/><br/>Napoleon 1806 is a game at the crossroads of history and simulation.<br/> Napoleon 1806 is the culmination of two history and wargame enthusiasts, Denis Sauvage and Julien Busson, who wished to share this passion with you. <br/>With Napoleon 1806, in 1 to 2 hours, two players will relive the clashes between Prussian and French at the heart of the imperial conquests of Napoleon the 1st, which culminated in the battles of Auerstaedt and Jena.<br/><br/>Napoleon 1806 is intended for wargaming seasoned grognards as well as for young conscripts who want to try a new playful sensation. Strategy, anticipation and decision are the engines of the Napoleon 1806 game system.<br/><br/>The rules of Napoleon 1806 are divided into three parts and can be learnt in fifteen minutes. The first one, called &quot;Rules of the Conscript&quot;, allows to acquire all the notions of the game easily. The second, &quot;Rules of the Grognard&quot;, brings more finesse including &quot;fog of war&quot;. The last, &quot;Rules of the Marshal&quot;, allows to play Napoleon 1806 in competition.<br/><br/>Will you meet the challenge of doing as well as the Emperor Napoleon or will you succeed in thwarting his plans at the head of the Prussian forces?<br/><br/>How to play Napoleon 1806:<br/><br/>A game of Napoleon 1806 is played in 7 turns, each representing two days of campaign. Players alternate operations with their army corps. Fatigue and losses accumulate until the breaking point of one of the two armies causing the defeat of a player.<br/><br/>The game is based on cards to perform moves and combats. Even if luck is present, strategy is key to victory. Moving your army corps on different approach paths to facilitate maneuvers, managing the fatigue of your men generated by marching and fighting, concentrating your forces in order to win the decisive battle; these are the challenges you will face.<br/><br/>The French troops are more numerous and more experienced than those of their opponent, but time is short before the arrival of the Russian reinforcements, and the Prussian army is not to be underestimated! The French player to win will have to master the art of attacking and speed of action. The Prussian player, although defensive, will have to seize the opportunities presented to him to counter-attack and surprise his opponent. As the game is fast, each player will have the opportunity to take charge of the fate of both armies in one evening.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Denis Sauvage"], "categories": ["Napoleonic", "Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Napol\u00e9on 1806", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 120, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 8.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 3}, "213839": {"mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Player Elimination", "Set Collection"], "usersrated": 1, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3281171.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 2, "trading": 0, "id": 213839, "yearpublished": 2016, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 1, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3281171_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Web published)"], "families": [], "description": "Don&rsquo;t look now, but the cutest viruses you&rsquo;ve ever seen are are on the loose and trying to get you sick!

You will be weaving your own stories, worthy of the greatest comic book sagas. Whether you&rsquo;re a seasoned veteran of tabletop miniature games, or a new recruit to this rewarding hobby, you&rsquo;ll soon be controlling your own super-team, and battling for control of Metropolis, the Earth at large, or even the entire galaxy!<br/><br/>The DC Universe Miniature Game is designed for two or more players, with each taking control <br/>of a number of finely detailed miniatures, representing their faction, or team. The miniatures are in essence playing pieces, much like those you&rsquo;d find in a board game. But unlike most board games, a miniature game doesn&rsquo;t take place on a readily defined board, but rather the players take an active role in designing their own custom gaming area, usually on a tabletop <br/>populated by scratch-built scenery. The rules use a sophisticated system of power counters <br/>and unique character abilities, allowing you to move your models freely and utilize a large <br/>range of skills and powers to give you a tactical edge over your opponents.<br/><br/>The game is scenario based, although You can play a simple deathmatch just for fun.<br/><br/>Sequence of Play<br/><br/>Each Round is broken down into four distinct phases, which proceed in the following order:<br/><br/>1.  Power Phase: Players distribute Power counters to each of the models in their team, usually <br/>up to the character&rsquo;s Power value. If a character is KO, Power counters are instead generated.<br/><br/>2.  Initiative Phase: Players determine the order in which they will proceed through the round. This <br/>stage adds a level of unpredictability to the game &ndash; you might go first this round, but end up <br/>going last in the next.<br/><br/>3.  Action Phase: The players activate each character in turn &ndash; moving, fighting, shooting, and <br/>resolving special actions. Play alternates, with the player who went first activating a single <br/>model, then the second player activates a model, and so on, until all models that can act <br/>have done so.<br/><br/>4.  Final Phase: Some special effects must also be resolved in this phase. This is also a &lsquo;tidying up&rsquo; phase, where Power counters are removed and scenario victory conditions are checked. If, at the end of the Final Phase, one player&rsquo;s entire crew is Knocked Out and/or has been <br/>removed from play, the game ends and the other player is declared the victor.<br/><br/>Every test/combat (To Hit, Agility etc.) is resolved by rolling dice, usually 2d8.<br/><br/>About the starter set:<br/><br/>This is the incarnation of Batman, Superman &amp; Wonder Woman from the DC cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>Now you can take to the streets of Gotham, Metropolis or even Themyscira with the DC Miniatures game.

But, the assumption here is that, instead, both Moscow and Washington were drawn into the conflict and deployed combat forces to support their respective camp.

The player oversees several game characters as they fulfill missions in this challenging environment. These characters represent a declining pagan population that is caught between the New Religion and the spiteful counter religion known as the Growing Evil. This latter division includes ruffians, malicious necromancers, the infamous NecroFiend occultists, and demons from foul depths.<br/><br/>The game is divided into 3 stages to represent the different missions to be undertaken. Each mission/stage involves coping with the New Religion in some way. In the first stage you seek to undo damage created by the New Religion. In the second stage you must impede the New Religion. And finally the third stage requires that you directly confront the New Religion.<br/><br/>GAME-PLAY:<br/>Player guided characters will travel on a map that is generated by land tiles. These tiles are drawn and placed as the characters move from turn to turn. At the same time, game controlled characters known as NecroFiends will be spawned; eventually traveling the tile map through an automated movement system. When player characters run into a NecroFiend, conflict is likely to occur.<br/><br/>In addition to NecroFiends, opposition can emerge through the Occurrence deck (from entering a tile) or through the Demon deck (upon exiting a tile). These encounters gnaw away at a characters vital resource --their followers. Followers are represented by purple cubes. When a game character (aka Leader) takes losses due to conflict, some or all of their followers are removed. A lack of followers makes a character extremely vulnerable and will often lead to elimination from the game if more followers cannot be acquired soon.<br/><br/>Combat in the world of Black Metal is resolved through two means, Brute Conflict and DarkArts Conflict. The former combat type is associated with physical conflict and uses a Combat Results Table involving up to three 4-sided dice. The latter combat type is associated with sorcery and uses a simpler system involving the combatants INSIGHT ratings and a single 4-sided die.<br/><br/>OBJECT:<br/>The player aims to fulfill at least one mission during the game. The game offers the opportunity to perform up to three missions. Missions are drawn from a deck and will describe locations that must be visited, along with actions that must be performed at these locations. Actions often include a special die roll procedure to solidify the outcome. The third mission will always involve conflict (using the games conflict resolution system).<br/><br/>WINNING THE GAME :<br/>To win Black Metal a player must fulfill every mission that is embarked upon. There are 3 levels of success --one for each mission that you accomplish. The game is lost if all player characters perish during the performance of missions, regardless of how many missions have been completed. The earned titles of success are as follows:<br/><br/>1 Mission Fulfilled  = Hero Status<br/>2 Missions Fulfilled  = Liberator Status<br/>3 Missions Fulfilled  = Legend Status<br/><br/>Without losing, you may end a game after any mission (but before another has begun).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Eric Vannoy"], "categories": ["Fantasy", "Horror"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Black Metal", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 180, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "216758": {"mechanics": ["Point to Point Movement", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 216758, "yearpublished": 2015, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "", "publishers": ["The Canadian Group"], "families": [], "description": "The Fun Family Race Game!<br/><br/>In Ooops!, players attempt to move their pawns from Start to Home in this Pachisi / Sorry! type game.

Most players will step into the shoes of LAPD homicide detectives, hungry for glory and willing to do whatever it takes to successfully close a case, even if that means intimidating suspects, concealing evidence, and hiring snitches to rat on their fellow detectives. One player, however, will take on the role of The Chisel, who&rsquo;s only goal is to stall and misdirect the detectives at every turn using bluffing, manipulation, and (often) outright lies.<br/><br/>Detective: CoA uses an innovative question &amp; response system to create the feel of interrogating a suspect. Suspects do not simply give paragraph-book responses. Instead, The Chisel carefully chooses how they will answer. When Billy O&rsquo;Shea insists that the victim was a regular at Topsy&rsquo;s Nightclub, is he telling the truth or is The Chisel subtly leading the detectives toward a dead end that will cost them precious time? Detectives can challenge responses that they think are lies but at great risk: if they&rsquo;re wrong, The Chisel will acquire leverage over them, making the case that much harder to solve.<br/><br/>Detective: CoA includes separate, detailed casebooks for both the detectives and The Chisel. Each crime is a carefully constructed puzzle that can unfold in a variety of ways depending on how the detectives choose to pursue their investigations. As the detectives turn the city upside down, uncovering fresh evidence and &lsquo;hot&rsquo; leads, hidden suspects may be revealed and new lines of questioning will open up, creating a rich, story-driven experience.<br/><br/>Inspired by classic film noir like The Big Sleep, the works of James Ellroy (L.A. Confidential), and the video game L.A. Noire from Rockstar Games, Detective: City of Angels is a murder-mystery game unlike any other. Will one detective rise above the rest and close the case on L.A.&rsquo;s latest high profile murder?

For generations the monks had been training for this moment, and as Sho-Riu descended on the temple, they gathered their strength and prepared to fulfill their destiny.<br/><br/>But their victory was not to be.

Taking on a human-fox form, the Kitsune uses supernatural tricks and auras to protect the Heroes, while darting between enemies to deliver killing blows with her deadly blades.<br/>4 New Enemy Types<br/><br/>Chochinobake &ndash; These demon-possessed, animated lanterns swarm the Heroes, relentlessly biting and burning them with terrifying speed.<br/><br/>Takobake Warriors &ndash; Once a noble clan, the Takobake have embraced the power of the Dark Stone.

The game is introduced by means of a mysterious letter which informs the reader that they must lead a team of courageous people to fight back against the malevolent forces that threaten to overtake Barchester. The game can be played with basic rules or with a host of tactical rules as player&rsquo;s become used to the flow of the game. A player can play a solitaire game where they control the Protagonists with the aim of banishing the Monsters to claim victory (the Monster being played by A.I. mechanics in the game). Alternatively a 2 player game can be played where one side takes control of the Protagonists and the other side the Monsters. Both sides choose a starting team of 15 from their decks; each card has 4 attribute statistics. Each turn take place at a different location, which may allow counters to be played or benefits to accrue. The Protagonist cards can be equipped with Boon cards that can be found at the various locations. The turn has 4 phases: organise, initiate, engage and resolve. The Protagonist and Monster players take alternate turns to hold the location and decide the type of encounter, which is kept secret from their opponent. The responding player must try and guess what strategy is being used and play their hand accordingly. The controlling player can see the card images but not the statistics, so uses their knowledge to try and play the best cards to win the encounter. The cards are then revealed and the statistics compared. An encounter table is consulted to determine the outcomes.

These people were given outdated firearms, and were forced to kill one another. There were two reasons for the Government to do this: one was to collect battle data through the experimental battles, and the other was as an easy way to dispose such troublesome people.<br/><br/>Dokugasu Zangousen is a three-dimensional chess-like board game. In a 7x7 square grid board, you may make a hump (place a cube) or dig an entrenchment (remove a cube) to avoid lines of fire or to hinder enemy's movement. But entrenchment is vulnerable to poison gas which tends to go downward into holes.<br/><br/>Players initially have two soldiers each. At the beginning of each round, players place two action cards face-down in front of them. Then first player takes all actions they have placed.<br/><br/>During your turn, you may do two of the following  actions as you have programmed:<br/>1) Move: Move one of your soldiers one square orthogonally, or advance the soldier two squares forward.<br/><br/>2) Turn: Turn the direction of one of your soldiers.<br/><br/>3) Construct: Place a cube on a square adjacent to one of your soldiers. Or remove a cube from in front of the soldier.<br/><br/>4) Fire: Fire a gun from one of your soldiers orthogonally to kill an enemy or destroy a cube. Or throw a bag of poison gas to kill soldiers within an affected area, which is determined by wind direction.<br/><br/>5) Dig: Dig an entrenchment at the exact square of one of your soldiers.<br/><br/>6) Item: One of your soldier wears or takes off a gas mask. While wearing the mask, the soldier gains protection from poison but is unable to advance two squares, construct, or move cubes. Or one of your soldier takes a drug for two extra actions.<br/><br/>7) Camp: Retrieve one or all action cards you have played so far.<br/><br/>You score one point when you kill one of your enemies, or when you move one of your soldier outside the board across the opponent's border.

The forces of the two Soviet Fronts met each other near Zvenigorodka three days later.

You score points by taking these cards.<br/><br/>Each round, players play a card under trick-taking rules (must follow suit, no trumps). Basically, the player who played the highest rank, regardless of which suit, wins the trick. But there are several exceptions. One example is that if you and other player play a child of the same suit, both of you take that child card and score one point, instead of being taken by the winner of the trick.<br/><br/>In a four-player game, you win the game with your partner if your team takes honor cards more than your opponent team.<br/><br/>In a three-player game, the player who played Old Man (Red 15) competes against the other two.

RULES OF THE GAME MODE DUEL<br/>- Cards needed: the whole deck except JIKAN DESU, HANSOKU marks, IPPON marks<br/>- Number of players: 2-4<br/>- Duration: 4-5 min. with 2 players<br/><br/>Starting the game<br/>1. Before the start the following cards should be discarded from the deck: JIKAN DESU, HANSOKU marks, IPPON marks. The other cards should be divided into 3 subdecks:<br/>a. Basic attacks (Men, Kote, Do, Tsuki)<br/>b. Counterattacks<br/>c. All other cards<br/><br/>These subdecks should be shuffled and placed to the marks on the gameboard face-down.<br/><br/>2. Deal 3x basic attacks (Men, Kote, Do, Tsuki), 4x counterattacks and 5x from the other cards to each player.<br/>3. At the beginning, players can switch any 2 of their cards to other cards, each from its own subdeck. The new card should be drawn from the top of the subdeck and your switched card should be put under it. Switching a card is not compulsory.<br/>4. Add the numbers on your basic attack cards: the player with a higher result starts the first attack. If more players got the same total, switch the card with the lowest number on it to a new one from its own subdeck. Examine your totals again.<br/>5. You can start a new or first attack with the following cards and combinations:<br/>    - Men, Kote, Do, Tsuki attacks: a) alone or b) together with one reinforcing card (Jodan or Seme)<br/>    - Other attacking cards (Taiatari, Maki age). These two can only be played alone without reinforcing cards.<br/>6. An attack aiming a certain part of the body can always be countered with a same attacking card or an appropriate counterattack card. For example, a single MEN attack can be countered with the same MEN card, or a counterattack, which answers, so starts with MEN. A counterattack can also be answered with another appropriate counterattack or single attack card, and so on.<br/><br/>However, if you answer a counterattack with a basic attack card, your opponent can then start a new attack and does not need to answer your card.<br/><br/>7. If you are attacked with a single attack with a MEN, KOTE&hellip; etc. or a counterattack; OR a basic attack reinforced with a JODAN or SEME card, you must always react to it.<br/><br/>- If you are attacked with a basic attack with a reinforcing card, you must react to the reinforcing one first. You can try to neutralize it, deflect or reflect it. If you can&rsquo;t do any of these, your opponent pulls one card from you and can use it as one&rsquo;s own.<br/>- After reacting to a reinforcing card, you must react to the basic attack, too.<br/>- If you can&rsquo;t react to a MEN, KOTE, DO, TSUKI attack / counterattack, you lose two cards to your attacker.<br/>- If you are attacked with a TAIATARI or MAKI AGE card, and you have no valid card against it, you lose one card to your opponent, which he or she may choose without seeing your cards.<br/><br/>8. If you lose a card to another player:<br/>    - in case of 2-3 players: it&rsquo;s your turn to start a new attack against any of the other players;<br/>    - in case of 4 players: the player, who got your card can start a new attack, attacking anyone except you.<br/>9. If you cannot react to an incoming attack, and have no cards to give away or to start with when it&rsquo;s your turn, you lose the game. In case of 3-4 players playing, you drop out.<br/><br/>After you dropped out, your last attacker can draw one card from any of the subdecks as a bonus and can start a new attack.<br/>When 3 players are in the game, the player who did not receive a bonus card starts the next attack.<br/><br/>10. If it is your turn to start an attack, but you don&rsquo;t have any valid cards, you should discard one of your cards and draw a new one from the basic attacks subdeck and use that.<br/>11. In case of 2-3 players: if you can react to an attack with a valid card, you are free to choose whom you would like to attack with your used card.<br/><br/>In case of 4 players: you cannot attack your attacker with a single basic or counterattack, except when you use a card that deflects or reflects an attack directly.<br/><br/>Hikiwake (draw): when 2 players play, the game ends in a draw if the last applied valid card of any of the players is a TSUBAZERIAI or a BOGYO. When more than 2 players play, in this case this player simply drops out.<br/><br/><br/>II. RULES OF THE GAME VERSION &ndash; COMPETITION<br/>Cards needed: all the cards<br/>Number of players: only 2<br/>Duration: 10-20 mins<br/><br/>Aim of the game:<br/>The winner is the one who gets the second Ippon (point) first, or successfully plays the JIKAN DESU (Time&rsquo;s over!) card.<br/>It is considered as an IPPON (point) if a player cannot react to a basic or counterattack with a valid card OR has no more cards at all OR gets one&rsquo;s second Hansoku or penalty points.<br/>After an IPPON is awarded, all players draw as many new cards from any of the subdecks, that they have at least 6 cards in their hands. If you have more than 6, you can keep them but cannot draw more.<br/><br/>HANSOKU or penalty point must be given when:<br/>1. &lsquo;Stepping out of the court&rsquo;: you couldn&rsquo;t react to a TAIATARI card.<br/>2. &lsquo;Losing the sword&rsquo;: you couldn&rsquo;t react to a MAKI AGE card.<br/>The second hansoku you suffer means an IPPON to your opponent, and this is marked with a &bdquo;H&rdquo; as an ippon for hansoku.<br/>If it is your turn to start an attack but you have no valid card to do so, draw one card from the basic attacks subdeck and play that card.<br/>After an IPPON is awarded or a HANSOKU is given, always the &bdquo;unlucky&rdquo; player starts a new attack.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>Rule to switch cards: Always before you play a card, you must switch one of your cards to a new one from any of the sub-decks (without showing). Put your old card under its own subdeck.<br/><br/>AND you must draw a new card from the Counterattacks or the Other Cards sub-deck. You cannot draw this new one from the basic attacks subdeck.<br/><br/>Exception to the rule: if you play a BOGYO or a TSUBAZERIAI card, an IPPON is awarded or a HANSOKU is given, you are not allowed to switch and draw again one after another. However, after an Ippon you can still draw cards until you have 6, as mentioned above. It means that if you get a HANSOKU or your opponent receives an IPPON because you have already switched and drawn, but still could not react, you are not allowed to switch and draw again. You must play a card directly from your actual hand.<br/><br/>Starting the game<br/>At the beginning deal 2 cards from the basic attacks subdeck, 3 cards from the counterattacks, and 3 cards from the other cards subdeck to each player. During the game players play cards in turns according to the rules of the Duel mode and as well as the information written on the cards.<br/><br/>The first attacker is decided exactly the same way as in the Duel mode.<br/>The differences between the Duel and the Competition:<br/>The Competition is played with less cards in hand, and players switch and draw cards during the game, which is not possible during the Duel.<br/>When you attack successfully during the Duel, you get cards from your opponent. During the Competition, you are awarded an Ippon or your opponent gets a penalty.<br/>Gameboard: the divided subdecks must be placed on the marked places on the gameboard. The already played cards can be placed to the competition court.<br/>In the Competition, the Ippon marks can be placed on the marked area &rsquo;Scores&rsquo; to show the points awarded.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["\u00c1kos Vachter"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Fighting", "Sports"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Kendo Duel", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 20, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "218293": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Set Collection", "Variable Player Powers", "Worker Placement"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3363381.png", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 218293, "yearpublished": 2017, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3363381_t.png", "publishers": ["Final Frontier Games"], "families": [], "description": "Five years after the events of Cavern Tavern, where a fragile peace was brokered between The Five Realms, the High Queen Tabita Orestes has ordered a new city to be built.

Through these explorations, the Acolytes discovered a rare metal. This metal was named quickSilver and had the unique ability to be molded into other shapes, mimicking the currency of the other Exterra colonies that eventually spread across the galaxy.<br/><br/>As the Acolyte colonies' wealth grew, there were threats from opposing Megacorporations such as the Covenant, who desired more wealth and power. A few of the Megacorporations were willing to use force to take over trading routes by destroying trade starships, and even razing corporate Homeworlds to the ground if a colony was unwilling to share its profits.<br/><br/>As a result, each Exterra colony was forced to build starships to protect merchant fleets and their Homeworlds, though sometimes protecting an empire implied being the aggressor. These conflicts have become known throughout the galaxy as the Tradewars.<br/><br/><br/>Tradewars: Homeworld  is a 1-4 player competitive space battle deck-building game, which utilizes three different scenarios to determine how the game is won:<br/><br/><br/>    Tradewars: Players must balance the collection of wealth with their need to defend their Homeworld.<br/>    Spacewars: This scenario is all about survival. Be the last player standing to win.<br/>    The Derelict: A single-player scenario that focuses on surviving an assault.<br/><br/><br/>During a player's turn, the player first selects any 1 of the 10 roles in the game, which are:<br/><br/><br/>    Chancellor: Can initiate a diplomatic vote to reach an agreement in the game<br/>    Treasurer: Discard cards for funds<br/>    Admiral: Control multiple starships<br/>    Captain: Reconfigure starships<br/>    Commander: Reconfigure crews<br/>    Engineer: Reconfigure weapons<br/>    Sergeant: Force all opponents to discard<br/>    Private: Force 1 opponent to discard<br/>    Smuggler: Force  1 opponent to discard and then the player collects funds<br/>    Trader: Draw cards<br/><br/><br/>The scenarios determine which of the 10 roles are more desirable during the game, though each role has its purpose. Players must determine what actions and benefits they need in order to move their agenda forward. Once the role is resolved, the player may trade cards to buy Upgrade cards.<br/><br/><br/>Cards may also be sold to increase the player's Treasury value. The galactic currency, quickSilver (QS), can easily be shaped to represent any other currency, but at much lower cost.<br/><br/><br/>Adjustments are made on the Progress Mat whenever necessary and in accordance to card effects or player actions. Wealth, Life Points, and the number of starships the player can build are kept track on the mat.<br/><br/><br/>When a player acquires starships, they may deploy them to the &quot;Space Lane&quot;, which act as walls to protect their Homeworld from invasion. Before a starship can be deployed, it must be configured, which entails connecting 3 Upgrade cards; the starship Upgrade card, crew Upgrade card, and weapons upgrade card. Configuration of a starship means that it is manned, armed and ready to fly. Each Upgrade card has an Energy rating (or &quot;capacity&quot;),Crew rating (or &quot;resistance&quot;), and Weapon rating (or &quot;firepower&quot;).<br/><br/>A player may command up to 4 starships at a time, from an array of 5 unique classes. Starships can be configured in up to 125 different combinations.<br/><br/><br/>Combat is initiated when the player decides to use their starships to attack an opponent&rsquo;s starships or an opponent&rsquo;s unprotected homeworld. Attacking is only possible if the player elects to take the Admiral role for their turn.<br/><br/>Attacks can be done with 1 or more starships and the attacker gets to decide which of the opponent&rsquo;s ships are included in the skirmish.<br/><br/>Initiative is determined by rolling dice. If the attacking player wins the initiative, the battle continues. If not, the opponent is able to escape the fight.<br/><br/><br/>A player's turn ends when the player is done taking all their actions, at which point they may draw back up to 5 cards. If their draw deck is exhausted, the discard pile is shuffled and becomes the new draw deck.<br/><br/>The players continue to take turns until the game is won. The victory condition is determined by the scenario selected by the players. Once the objective has been met, the game is over and the winner is announced.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Kristopher R.

Unfortunately for those in their front-line units, both the training and equipment usually only make them ready for the previous war, not the one they're about to fight. Beyond that, the initial period of such wars is characterized by only a partially abandoned peacetime psychology among the officers and enlisted. That is, no one as yet appreciates what it means operatively to be in an all-out war. All that comes together to give overall performance high-risk, volatile and fragile qualities: no one as yet really knows what's actually possible or wise to try to accomplish.

A Spanish Galleon floats nearby, and you&rsquo;ve talked your crewmates into working together to steal all of its treasure. What you haven&rsquo;t told your fellow pirates is that you have no intentions on sharing the treasure once you have it. Your crewmates have told you that they share your loyalty and that they&rsquo;ll help you maroon the greedy pirates on your ship to the rocky island of Tortuga. But you&rsquo;ve seen your friends&rsquo; loaded pistols and heard their whisperings of a mutiny. You know that nobody can be trusted.<br/><br/>Tortuga is all about the interactions you have with the other players. In some cases, such as when you and your shipmates are attacking the Spanish Galleon, you need to rely on your enemies in order to succeed. In the very next turn, however, your shipmates might stab you in the back with a mutiny in order to keep all the treasure for themselves.<br/><br/>Since nobody holds a &quot;hand&quot; of cards, this game is also about knowledge and communication regarding the community Event cards. Unless you are in desperation mode, it is not wise to reveal Event cards at random. Almost half of the Event cards can hurt your team drastically. It's often in your best interest to use an action to view the cards first, or to rely on the knowledge of a trusted ally. Knowing where harmful Event cards are located allows you to force an enemy to reveal those cards and suffer the consequences. The most successful players are the ones who are able to discern who is on their team and then share vital information with them at opportune moments.<br/><br/>Vote cards also play a key role in the game. Each Vote card has three sections - one each for Attacks, Mutinies, and Brawls. Players must put themselves in the best position to use their Vote cards, since their hand of Vote cards may not always be ideal based on their pawn location. For example, sometimes it may be worth putting in Water, causing an attack to fail, in order to save a Crossbones card for when you want to Mutiny against your captain.<br/><br/>For 4-9 Players. 20-40 minutes.

Naive as a child in many ways, unfamiliar with the sophistry of civilization, he was naturally intelligent, jealous of his rights, and dangerous as a hungry tiger.

The goal of the game is to collect the most amount of tokens of any color by the end of the game. Playing pieces in the Berd game have ability to attach/detach to each other. That allows players to move a stack of tokens like a single units and split the structure when needed. Using interlocking blocks players can create towers and a certain type of tower - Berd has unique properties that make this game special. The design of the game is specially made simple underlying an easy and logical concept of the game. However the Berd is a serious game and you have to think strategically to win. The Berd game is very versatile: there are many options of the game. In fact the Berd is more than one game; it&rsquo;s like a game production kit. Using the unique concept of the Berd, gamers can develop new games or improve the existing ones.<br/>The Berd game can be played by two and more players. The goal of the game is to collect the most amount of tokens.  Specifically for two players the game can be played with two or four color tokens. <br/>There is a version of the Berd game where players can trade tokens with other players. <br/>There is a Berd game without dice played by two players. This game is an abstract strategy game like checkers; it&rsquo;s last about 5-7 minutes. <br/>Duration of any option of the Berd game depend on how many tokens are played. So players can set up a rapid game of 10 minutes or a long game of 90 minutes. <br/>The Berd game perfectly fits for tournaments because players can accumulate collected tokens (or points) in series of games with different players. <br/>The Berd game is pending for the US patent and international PCT registration.<br/><br/>Game setting<br/>At the beginning of the game, each player chooses the corner from where he/she will start from and place their stacked tokens on that corner&rsquo;s square. Each player will get equal amount of tokens of his/her color. The starting corner square will also be the ending corner for a player. Players can choose any corner including those that have been already taken. In this case, the different color stacked tokens will be placed in the same corner square.<br/><br/>Some definitions:<br/>1. Tower &ndash; a stack of 2 or more tokens (any color). The color of the token on top represents who owns that tower. An unprotected tower (please see definition below) moves like a single token.<br/>2. Berd &ndash; two or more tokens of the same color stacked on each other on the top of a tower. A Berd is considered a protected tower. <br/>3. Unprotected Tower/Token &ndash; any token or tower which is not considered a &ldquo;Berd.&rdquo; <br/>4. Double &ndash; when you roll the same number on each die. In this case, you are to play the number 4 times.<br/>5. Active Token &ndash; a token is still on the board that hasn&rsquo;t been captured (please see picture)<br/>6. Inactive token/s -- token/s captured in a tower or Berd by other color token. Inactive token/s is/are stacked under the active token/s<br/>7. Active Player &ndash; player who still has active tokens<br/>8. Recovering inactive token/s: a player can recover his/her inactive token/s, captured in an unprotecting tower, by landing on that tower. In this case the player will create a Berd having more than one of his/her tokens on the top. <br/><br/><br/>Process of the game<br/>Players roll 2 dices and move tokens on the board by counting squares in the clockwise direction. You can play with one token both scores of the dice, or play each value of the die by separate tokens. <br/>Players will capture an opponent&rsquo;s token or unprotected tower when they land on them. However, you can&rsquo;t capture a Berd and you can&rsquo;t land on a square that has a Berd on it. If you capture an unprotected tower that contains your color token inside, then you will restack the whole tower and put your color tokens on the top, creating a Berd. When you capture an unprotected token or tower, then you can move your new unprotected tower with the captured tokens attached to the bottom like a single unit-token. There is no limit of capturing other tokens. However, if you create a Berd, you cannot move it all at once. You have to split up your Berd so you create unprotected token or tower that can move as a single unit. If your Berd contains opponent&rsquo;s tokens, these must be attached to at least one of your tokens when moving or staying. You can split captured tokens in any combination when splitting your Berd but they must be attached under your token/s.<br/>When you roll a double, you can play the scored points four times. That is a great advantage especially with Berd because you can move two or more tokens simultaneously, so they will remain protected. <br/>When a player finishes one of his/her token by reaching the starting corner, he/she will collect one token from each active player. In order to finish, you don&rsquo;t have to land exactly on the corner square that you started from; you can go over. Other players should decide what color and from where to give a token to the finished player. They can give any token in their possession, whether from the board or from already finished tokens. When finishing, you only get tokens based on how many of your own color finished.<br/><br/>The game is over when only one active player remains. Now it&rsquo;s time to identify the winner. The winner is the player who collected and finished the most tokens (tokens left on the board are not counted).You can just stack all your collected tokens and compare to see whose tower is taller.<br/><br/>Variations of the game<br/>This game set has many game options:<br/>1. Short path simple game &ndash; this is a basic Berd game played on the side of the folding board with a shorter path. This game lasts about 25 minutes (4 players x 9 tokens). The duration of the game can be shortened with fewer players and/or using fewer tokens<br/>2. Long path simple game - this is a basic Berd game played on the side of folding board with a longer path. This game lasts about 40 minutes (4 players x 9 tokens) <br/>3. Game with color protection - both 1 and 2 games can be played with color protection. Players can use colored squares on the board for protection from being captured by the opponents token. For example: Blue color player&rsquo;s single token or unprotected tower will be protected on the Blue square. Other players can&rsquo;t capture the Blue token on the blue square and they can&rsquo;t land on the blue square if it&rsquo;s occupied by the Blue token. The rest of the game rules are same as for the basic Berd game <br/>4. Game with numbered tokens &ndash; 1, 2, and 3 games can be played with numbered tokens. Each color tokens have different weights/scores (10; 20; 30; 40; 50; 60; 70; 80 and 90), shown on the tokens. This option of the game provides more possibilities for moves. The winner will be a player who collects highest total score. In order to play this version of the game you need to attach the numbered stickers. There are lines on the sides of the token for even attachment.<br/>5. Game with hidden numbers &ndash; 1, 2, and 3 games can be played with tokens that have hidden numbers (numbers are not displayed outside, they are attached inside). This game is similar to game #4 with the difference that only the player who possesses a token can see the weight of that token. This feature introduces more intrigue and uncertainty about end result of the game. Also this version of game allows players to bet.<br/>6. Berd game without dice &ndash; this game is different from the race game on the path. The two sided small board with color squares used for this game. One side has 3x3 squares and other side has 4x4 squares. The goal of the game is to collect more tokens than your opponent. Players move their tokens one token and one square at a time forward or lateral move. You can&rsquo;t move tokens diagonally. While you can move your token laterally however you can&rsquo;t do lateral movement more than three times in consecutive moves. Similar to the Berd race game you can capture an unprotected token or tower. You can move an unprotected tower like one single token. The rules of creating a Berd and playing tokens from the Berd is applied here. <br/>For the game setting players set their tokens on the base lines (the first line on the field where a player starts). One player starts from one side of the board and the other player starts from other side of the board. Each player has its own color; both players start with equal amount of tokens of their color.

(To play all permutations of player numbers and board sizes would require approximately 85 pieces in one color, 85 pieces in a second color, 55 pieces in a third color, and 45 pieces in a fourth color.)<br/><br/>Basic idea:      In Archipelago, players try to create more islands (i.e. groups of two or more adjacent pieces) than opponents create.<br/><br/>RULES<br/><br/>A group (&quot;island&quot;) is a connected set of two or more same-colored stones. Each player is the owner of a single color of stone.  An island in a given color will count toward its color-owner's score, regardless of whether the color-owner or an opponent created that island.<br/><br/>Players are allowed three stone placements per turn. (Exception: the first player in a two player game plays just two stones on his/her very first turn. See the section SPECIAL RULES BY PLAYER NUMBER below.) These three stones can be ANY color (i.e. on your turn, you needn't play any of your own color of stones if you don't wish to; you can play any color or any mix of colors in a single turn). A stone can be played to any empty cell; once placed, stones do not move.<br/><br/>Additionally, a player is permitted to play a bonus stone (of any color of his/her choice) for every opponent who is strictly ahead of him/her in the current group score; each player's &quot;group score&quot; = the number of distinct groups in his/her color.  (Note that when using a score track, the number of bonus stones you are allowed is always equal to the number of opponent stones strictly ahead of you on the track at the start of your turn.)<br/><br/>Bonus stone examples: In a two player game, the trailing player gets one bonus stone and thus plays 4 stones to the board (the default three stones + the bonus stone). In a three player game with each player having a distinct number of groups, the second-place player plays 4 stones and the last-place player plays 5 stones. In a three player game with two players tied for first-place, the last-place player plays 5 stones. In a three player game with two players tied for last-place, each last-place player plays 4 stones.<br/><br/>When the board is full, or when all players have consecutively passed their turns, the game ends. The winning order is determined by the greatest number of groups. In the case of a tie, the tied player with the &ldquo;highest ever&rdquo; group score (i.e. the highest score ever reached over the course of the game) is the winner. If the tied players have the same highest ever score, then the first player to have reached that high score wins. (This status can be easily tracked on a score board &ndash; see the score board instructions below.)<br/><br/>Tie break examples: <br/>&bull;    Players A and B are tied at the game's end with four groups each.  Player A never had more than four groups, but at one point earlier in the game Player B had five groups, which A subsequently reduced back to four groups via sabotage, by playing a stone in B's color to join two of B's formerly distinct groups. Player B wins on the tie break, since B's &quot;highest ever score&quot; is 5 versus A's 4. <br/>&bull;    Players A and B are tied at the game's end with five groups each, but earlier in the game (not necessarily at the same time) each player had seven groups. Then the first player to have achieved seven groups is the winner. <br/>&bull;    Players A and B are tied at the end of the game with six groups each, and at no point did either player have more than six groups. Then the first player to have reached six groups is the winner.<br/><br/>SPECIAL RULES BY PLAYER NUMBER<br/><br/>TWO PLAYERS:<br/><br/>To neutralize the first player advantage, the first player plays only two stones on his her turn. Thereafter players play three on stones on each of their turns (plus any bonus stones they are entitled to).<br/><br/>THREE PLAYERS<br/><br/>Each player, even the first player, plays three stones per turn (plus any bonus stones). There is no need to neutralize the first player advantage since the remaining players can be counted on to act together in a temporary alliance to neutralize any such advantage.<br/><br/>However, the following &quot;Frozen Irrelevance&quot; rule is recommended:<br/><br/>o    Frozen Irrelevance: When the board arrangement is such that a player's current rank (e.g. 1st, 2nd, or 3rd) is unalterable by any further play from any player, then that player's rank has assumed its final form, and he/she is &quot;frozen&quot; from further play. That is, he/she takes no further part in the game, and the game play continues on with just the non-frozen players.<br/><br/>FOUR PLAYERS<br/><br/>With four players, each player (including the first player) plays only TWO stones per turn (plus bonus stones). Also, &quot;Frozen Irrelevance&quot; is recommended. Finally, use just a 0.5 bonus stone for each player you strictly trail (rounding up).<br/><br/>VARIATIONS<br/><br/>&bull;    Bonus stones: Consider awarding no bonus stones at all. Alternatively (in a 3 player game), consider awarding just a 0.5 stone bonus for each opponent whom you strictly trail (rounding up).<br/><br/>&bull;    Default number of stones: The 2-3 player game may be adjusted by lowering the default number of stones per turn from 3 stones to 2 stones per turn.  The 4 player game can be tried with 3 stones per turn.<br/><br/>&bull;    Tie-break:  In a 2 player game, consider a different tie-break, namely, &ldquo;most recent leader&rdquo; wins a tie, i.e. the player who most recently had the lead wins.  To track this, use a &ldquo;leader token&rdquo; (e.g. a coin). This token starts the game unowned.  The player who makes the first group becomes the owner of the leader token.  He/she maintains ownership unless the opponent overtakes him/her in the group score (i.e. comes to have more groups; merely tying the leader does not change ownership).  Upon overtaking, the opponent becomes the new owner of the leader token, and maintains that ownership unless he/she is overtaken.  Note that in a case of losing a lead but remaining tied&mdash;and hence, not overtaken&mdash;ownership of the leader token is not changed (e.g. if the score goes from 2-1 to 1-1).  In the case a tie in group scores at the end of a game, the owner of the leader token wins.  (With this alternative tie-breaker, no &ldquo;bonus score track&rdquo; is needed.)<br/><br/>&bull;    Opening protocol: In a 2 player game, use a different opening protocol, namely, the first player on his/her first turn places just one stone, the second player on his/her first turn places two stones, and thereafter the default for each player is three stones (plus any bonus stones). Also, you can experiment with various opening stone protocols in the 3 and 4 player versions, if desired.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Craig Duncan", "Jo\u00e3o Pedro Neto", "Bill Taylor"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Print & Play"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Archipelago", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 45, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "214673": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Worker Placement"], "usersrated": 12, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3277190.png", "wishing": 10, "owned": 164, "trading": 2, "id": 214673, "yearpublished": 2016, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 2, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3277190_t.png", "publishers": ["Minion Games"], "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "The Manhattan Project"], "description": "The Manhattan Project: Energy Empire - Missile Crisis is a promotional card for The Manhattan Project: Energy Empire, originally unlocked as a stretch reward for backers of the Kickstarter project.<br/><br/>The card reads:<br/><br/>No environmental row is scored; instead, each player immediately scores 1 VP per space their United Nations marker has moved.

This game has three modes of play: hidden identity mode (saboteurs may exist), limited communication co-operative mode (players may not speak words), and random co-operative mode (players may not choose walls).<br/><br/>In hidden identity mode, players are secretly assigned a role: Builder or Saboteur. A Builder's goal is to build an eight-tier tower, and a Saboteur's goal is to make one of the builders collapse the tower.<br/><br/>Each player has three cards in their hand. In your turn, you place a floor card, which is numbered 1-5, face-up, and other players place a floor card face-down, saying a hint (saboteurs might be misleading you). Then you reveal one of these face-down card, combine it with yours to make a hexagonal floor, and take two walls that correspond to floor numbers. You must place the floor and the walls on top of tower without making it collapse. Height of walls gradually vary over floor numbers, so you should pick the same number if you want to build an upright tower.<br/><br/>If you are a saboteur, it's up to you whether you secretly or explicitly betray the builders. You may try to mislead builders to take unbalanced walls, or boldly build up a skewed tower in your turn. But beware. Your side loses the game if you make the tower collapse yourself.

Series, where  the Russian Front of World War II was first simulated,  then taking the action to the African Front, the Italian Front , the French &amp; Polish Fronts, game designer Carl Paradis now presents the fifth chapter: No Retreat 5: The Western Front 1944-45.<br/><br/>After the Fall of France in May of 1940, the Battle of Britain put a stop to Hitler&rsquo;s ambitions in the West. While his attentions turned eastwards towards the vast expanses of the Soviet Union, the German Army, occupying most of Western Europe, started fortifying the coastlines to defend the Nazi dictator&rsquo;s conquests against the resurgent Allied might: the vaunted &ldquo;Atlantic Wall&rdquo; was born. Soon, Allied troops will be knocking upon its doorstep&hellip;<br/><br/>In No Retreat 5, players command the Allied or German forces, invading or defending West Europe: France, Belgium, Holland and Germany proper. Maneuvering forces over hexes that are approximately 20 kilometers across, over turns that each represent between a week to a month of real time. The No Retreat series card-assisted game system is there to create on-map puzzles around each hex, unit and battle as the tense engagements rage back-and-forth and nothing is entirely predictable, and also manages the pre-invasion &ldquo;fog-of-war&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The game is split up in two different parts.<br/><br/>The Invasion Game:  Starting in 1943.  It will consist of the preparations preceding the Allied Invasion of Western Europe, with deception, intelligence and build-up efforts being showcased. The D-Day outcome is then gamed using intense weekly turns.<br/><br/>The Front Game: After the Allies are ashore, their beachhead secure (unless they are pushed back in the English Channel!), the rest of the game consists of monthly turns simulating the War in the West, up to the bitter end and probable surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945; the longer the game lasts, the stronger the Soviets position will be in Central Europe, or perhaps Hitler will be able to stave off total defeat long enough for an armistice and negotiated outcome?<br/><br/>The D-Day sea invasion will be shown in great detail, the German fortified positions also, with both players having to choose where to deploy their assets, where to attack, and what kind of troops to use and request from higher command. As the German commander, will you ask the OKW for more Panzers, or more bunkers and guns; will you gain full control of your mobile troops, or will you have limited control, as historically happened? As the Allied commander, will troops fighting in Italy be released to you for an end-run South of France invasion? Or perhaps you will decide to invade the Low Countries instead, trying to capture the important port of Antwerp in a surprise operation?<br/><br/>A simple but effective supply system will show the constraints the victorious Allied Armies suffered for a good part of the campaign after breaking out of their invasion beachhead. Special Event cards will simulate effortlessly the events happening on the Eastern Front, the effects of the strategic bomber offensive, the political pressures put on both players&rsquo; operations by their respective leaders, etc. Will Hitler let you use the Panzer reserves in time? Will Churchill make a bit for a more upfront role for the British units? Will Heavy Bombers be released for more tactical uses? All this and more will be shown and simulated. Embark in your Landing craft, keep watch in your concrete Bunker, the Invasion is coming, and there will be No Retreat!<br/><br/>Western Front Scenario Listing<br/>Regular Campaign Game: The Invasion Game, followed by the Front Game. Players will thus have a lot of leeway in their initial Strategic Choices. What if the Allies had invaded in le-pas-De-Calais instead of Normandy? What if the German Panzers were moved closer to the beaches?<br/>Historical Campaign Game:  The Game starts with the Invasion game already pre-set, and the Normandy landings. Historical OOBs only.<br/>Invasion Game Scenario: Only the first part of the game is played up to the resolution of the D-Day Invasion. Depending on its level of success, the outcome of the rest of the campaign, and victory is then determined using a set of special tables.<br/>Front Game Scenario: Only the second part of the game is played, starting with the Normandy Breakout.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>One 22x34 Mapboard (mounted and two-sided) <br/>Two sheets of 88, 2-sided square units (176 Total) <br/>One sheet of 112, 2-sided round/hex markers.<br/>One rule book (40 pages)<br/>One Scenario Book (24 pages)<br/>Six Play-aid cards<br/>Two decks of 55 Event Cards <br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Scale: Each unit is one Division or Corps: Each hex is about 20 kilometers from side to side for the main campaign map, smaller for the Invasion map.

Suetonius Paulinus stands ready to deal his final blow against a vicious insurgency in Rome&rsquo;s new province. Inspired by Rome&rsquo;s implacable opponents, the Druids, the remaining fanatical warriors of a two-year insurgency hold out on the island of Anglesey. Having made an amphibious landing on the island&rsquo;s shores, Paulinus and his legionaries must cut their way through fierce opposition on the beach.<br/><br/>While his cohorts ravage the island, a messenger reaches Paulinus with news of a tribe that is rampaging the eastern fringes of his province. The Iceni, led by Queen Boudicca, are reported to have murdered local Roman officials and their guards. Other reports soon arrive that the Iceni&rsquo;s revolt is gathering both force and momentum as local tribes are responding to Boudicca&rsquo;s call for open revolt. A large warrior force is said to be devastating Roman villas and farmsteads as it heads south towards the first Roman colony in Britannia, Camulodunum.<br/><br/>Paulinus realizes that with all four of his legions posted in the north and west, this new menace has the potential to ravage Roman colonies and cut his lines of communication. He faces the very real prospect of being Governor of Britannia in name only.<br/><br/>Battles of the Warrior Queen covers the major engagements during the rebellion of the Iceni tribe and Boudicca&rsquo;s allies against the legions of Emperor Nero. Led by Queen Boudicca, the rebellion would be the greatest British threat to nearly four centuries of Roman domination of Britain.<br/><br/>Battle of Mona Insulis<br/><br/>Separated from mainland Britain by the treacherous waters of the Menai Straits, Paulinus faced the challenge of making an opposed beach landing on the Welsh island of Mona Insulis (today&rsquo;s Anglesey). The Britons, arrayed along the shore in a dense and heavily armed line of battle, awaited the assault. Helping whip them into a battle frenzy were the Druid priests, for whom the island was their last sanctuary.<br/><br/>Battle of Camulodunum<br/><br/>On learning that the Iceni tribe had risen in revolt and were heading towards the Roman colony of Camulodunum (modern-day Colchester), the IXth Legion (named as &ldquo;Hispana&rdquo;) set off from its base in Lindum (modern-day Lincoln), under the command of legate Petillius Cerialis. Cerialis was a mercurial individual who had escaped the brink of military disaster before. His luck would be tried once again in his encounter with the Britons.<br/><br/>Battle of Bannaventa<br/><br/>After arriving on the mainland, Paulinus rode east and south in great haste. Outside Londinium news of the defeat of Cerialis and his IXth Legion reached him. Ordering evacuation of the city, Paulinus withdrew hurriedly northwards to the midlands and urgently concentrated the XIVth Gemina and the XXth Legions.<br/><br/>As Boudicca&rsquo;s horde approached, Paulinus drew up his troops in close order in a defile, protected on his flanks and in his rear by dense forest. He new that the Queen of the Iceni would struggle to keep her disparate coalition in check for long, and would soon be compelled to attack. Whichever way it went, this would likely be the final, climatic battle of Boudicca&rsquo;s rebellion against Rome.<br/><br/>To play this module you will need the maps, counters and rules that come with this module and the rules and some counters from Caesar, Conquest of Gaul.

In the game, each player assumes the role of a married couple spending a day visiting historic Golden Gate Park during their trip to San Francisco.<br/><br/>Players begin the game having just arrived from their hotel to the Music Concourse at the heart of Golden Gate Park. The time is 10:00am on a gorgeous weekend morning. Players will take turns traveling about the park visiting its varied attractions, ending the day at 5:30pm sharp for the trip back the hotel.<br/><br/>Every action taken by a player takes a certain amount of time, which must be spent wisely throughout the game. Walk, shuttle or taxi to places like the bison paddock, Stow Lake, Shakespeare Garden, or the California Academy of Sciences. In between attractions you will need to find time to eat&mdash;perhaps at the famed Beach Chalet&mdash;and to answer the call of nature. And you don&rsquo;t have unlimited funds so be sure to mind your budget for the day.<br/><br/>You will accumulate&mdash;or possibly lose!&mdash;valuable experience points along the way, with the player having had the best experience for the day declared the winner.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>&bull; a 17&rdquo; x 44&rdquo; mounted board<br/>&bull; one sheet of die-cut tiles <br/>&bull; four custom dice<br/>&bull; 84 wooden cubes, discs and meeples in four player colors<br/>&bull; wooden time tracker<br/>&bull; cloth bag<br/>&bull; rulebook<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Chad Jensen"], "categories": ["Travel"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Golden Gate Park", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 90, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 3}, "217196": {"mechanics": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3324346.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 217196, "yearpublished": 2016, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3324346_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Kuuri Keikaku (\u7a7a\u7406\u8a08\u753b)"], "families": [], "description": "User summary<br/>\u7bb1\u5ead\u306e\u56fd &quot;The Reclamation&quot; (Hakoniwa no kuni &quot;The Reclamation&quot;) (in English The Land of Miniascape &quot;The Reclamation&quot;).<br/><br/>Hakoniwa no Kuni is a two-player game with a theme of flower-growing in an enchanted garden.

This includes many of the meatpacking and food companies of the era: Oscar Mayer, Kraft, Quaker Oats, Nabisco, Swift &amp; Co, Armour &amp; Co, Schwinn Bicycles, Charles Schwab, and many others.<br/><br/>In City of the Big Shoulders players take on the role of entrepreneurs and investors looking to rebuild Chicago into a city fit for a world stage. In this unique merger of 18xx style stock manipulation mechanics with euro-style gameplay, players start companies, trade in shares, hire workers to man their factories and produce and sell goods to be delivered to homes across the midwest.<br/><br/>Although City of the Big Shoulders features a large amount of depth, strategy, and rewarding gameplay it features a shorter timeline than other heavy economic games of it's caliber. Players play just six rounds, in about 2 and a half hours. Each round consists of an an event, a company operation phase, share payouts, and a stock phase. At the end of these six rounds, the player with the best stock and money portfolio at the end of the game wins. Once complete, players cash out their shares for their final stock value, tally their money and celebrate in their economic victory.<br/><br/>After all, wouldn't you like to have solidified your economic legacy before the worst economic crisis in US History?

And a solo play based on goals.<br/><br/>In the 1970s, the governments of the world faced unprecedented demand for energy, and polluting power plants were built everywhere in order to meet that demand. Year after year, the pollution they generate increases, and nobody has done anything to reduce it. Now, the impact of this pollution has become too great, and humanity is starting to realize that we must meet our energy demands through clean sources of energy. Companies with expertise in clean, sustainable energy are called in to propose projects that will provide the required energy without polluting the environment. Regional governments are eager to fund these projects and to invest in their implementation.<br/><br/>If the pollution isn't stopped, it's game over for all of us.<br/><br/>In the game CO\u2082, each player is the CEO of an energy company responding to government requests for new, green power plants. The goal is to stop the increase of pollution while meeting the rising demand for sustainable energy &mdash; and of course profiting from doing so. You will need enough expertise, money, and resources to build these clean power plants. Energy summits will promote global awareness, and allow companies to share a little of their expertise while learning still more from others.<br/><br/>In CO\u2082, each region starts with a certain number of Carbon Emissions Permits (CEPs) at its disposal. These CEPs are granted by the United Nations, and they must be spent whenever the region needs to install the energy infrastructure for a project or to construct a fossil fuel power plant. CEPs can be bought and sold on a market, and their price fluctuates throughout the game. You will want to try to maintain control over the CEPs.<br/><br/>Money, CEPs, Green Power Plants that you've built, UN Goals you've completed, Company Goals you've met, and Expertise you've gained all give you Victory Points (VPs), which represent your Company's reputation &mdash; and having the best reputation is the goal of the game &hellip; in addition to saving the planet, of course.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Vital Lacerda"], "categories": ["Economic", "Environmental", "Industry / Manufacturing"], "name": "CO2 (second edition)", "playingtime": 120, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 4}, "214892": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3300821.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 214892, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3300821_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Educa Sallent SA"], "families": [], "description": "Numerous dangers await you as you set out on the journey to the final tower.

As you move, you drop the bottommost token in each village through which you pass, placing the dropped tokens on top of any totem already located there.<br/><br/>When a totem has three tokens stacked in it, the village it's in is influenced, with the player who owns the top token winning a number of fruits equal to the number on the village tile. After this, remove the tokens in this totem and return them to their owners. If a village has a 0 on it, then the tokens are returned with no one collecting fruit; if a village has -1, then the owner of the top totem removes one of their collected fruits from the game.<br/><br/>As soon as a player has four fruit, they win. If the fruit supply is empty, the game ends and whoever has the most fruit wins; in the event of a tie, continue to play until one player would win (or lose) a fruit to determine the winner.<br/><br/>Once you've played a few times, start using the Shaman rule. The second player places a Shaman between two villages before their first move, and no totem can be moved between these two villages. When a village with value 0 is influenced, the owner of the topmost token can move the Shaman to a new location, if desired.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Nicolas Sato"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Tiki", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 20, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "212629": {"mechanics": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Hand Management"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3251611.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 3, "trading": 0, "id": 212629, "yearpublished": 2016, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3251611_t.jpg", "publishers": ["COLON ARC"], "families": [], "description": "&quot;The stolen items will be taken by me... no, us!&quot;<br/>The knights would like to take the honor, ... no, they want just a public interesting.

The local CO-OP market is drowning in debt and the giant corporation MondoMart is threatening to take it over! The city has given the CO-OP just a few weeks to clean up its act. The CO-OP needs to raise money to pay back taxes and legal fees, or the city will sell the CO-OP and its assets to MondoMart to pay off the debts.<br/><br/>How can the CO-OP survive?<br/><br/>The CO-OP owners, all HIPPIES, have invited some like-minded business types to help them save the store. These folks, the so-called BIZZIES (BUSIness people: pronounced like biz-zees), will have to work together with the HIPPIES to save the CO-OP. Together, they will run it as a business (and keep it groovy), but they need to try a bunch of crazy things! However, the city's deadline is quicky approaching, so the group will have to try some pretty unorthodox methods to keep the CO-OP both profitable and groovy! They may even have to open the CO-OP to non-members!&quot;<br/><br/><br/><br/>CO-OP: the co-op game is a cooperative, variable player powers, hand management, marketplace card game for 1-5 players ages 12 and up (although kids ages 10 and up can play with their parent's help).<br/><br/>In CO-OP, all players assume the role of someone who works at the CO-OP (each with special powers).  Each player also has a VIBE track, representing how they are feeling today.  A global Money track represents how much money the CO-OP currently has.  To win, the CO-OP needs at least $10, and each player must be Groovy or Awesome on their individual VIBE chart.<br/><br/>Since the CO-OP is a store, the usual way to make money is to sell goods to Customers.  There is a Storefront where the CO-OP stocks goods to sell to Customers.  When the Storefront runs out of goods, the CO-OP can move goods from the Warehouse to the Storefront a variety of ways.   When the Warehouse runs out of goods, the CO-OP has to spend some money with Distributors to get more goods.  CO-OP is all about balancing when to buy, move, and sell goods.  But also staying groovy!<br/><br/>The game is broken up into days.  Each day, three things occur: A Happening, Players Turn, Clean-up.   A Happening at the start of the day sets-up today's challenge.  Then, each player gets a turn, usually playing a card.  These cards can be Customers (who buy goods from the CO-OP Storefront), Distributors (from whom we buy goods for the Warehouse), Instagroove cards (with instantaneous effect), or Continuous Groove cards (with lasting effects).  After each player plays, then we clean-up (doing end of turn maintenance).  And then start to the next day!<br/><br/>The game is over when the Happening card GAME OVER comes out.  At that time, the players either win or lose (if they have enough money and VIBE).<br/><br/>Players usually play cards on their turn, but they can also Meditate (to draw more cards), Frolic (cheer up their VIBE), Share (give cards back and forth with other players), and finally COOPERATE (work with other players).  A sample COOPERATE action is the Car Wash: you can't have a car wash with just one person!  There are limited number of COOPERATE actions, so they must be used strategically!<br/><br/>Players can play in any order on their turn to augment another player's turn: this is called Player Selected Turn Order, but it just means you can play in the order that best helps the players!<br/><br/>CO-OP is a game where players work together to discover the best way to balance VIBE, Money, Goods, and cards (Customers and Distributors).  We have to make enough money to save the CO-OP ($10), but we can't give in to the man ... everyone needs to be Groovy or Awesome!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Richard T.

Two more monsters (or your boss) appear on your path.<br/><br/>During the Dawn, the towers can attack one monster of a particular type on one of the 4 adjacent spaces, or the boss.<br/><br/>During the Day, each player can make one action between four, then they can make one more action, it can be the same.<br/><br/>Finally, the first player token goes to the next player.<br/><br/>THE ACTIONS<br/><br/>There is 4 different actions:<br/> - Build a tower<br/> - Extend your path<br/> - Go to the market (apply one of the available Market cards)<br/> - Make a quest (draw two cards in the Market deck)<br/><br/>In addition, you can play one of your Market cards in your hand after each of the three first actions, the best way to play more actions.<br/><br/>THE MONSTERS AND THE BOSS<br/><br/>Each monster type has a movement value (between 1 to 3 spaces) and maybe a special ability. All core box monsters has 2 life points.<br/><br/>The boss, who is not a monster, is harder to kill, with its 10 life points and when a player successes to kill him, the game is over.<br/><br/>Each time a monster or a boss leave your path to reach your city, you lose a number of city guards equal to their movement value. You begin at 15 and even if you lose your last one, you don't lose the game, you will just earn less victory points than the other players.<br/><br/>HOW TO WIN?<br/><br/>After the game end, each player adds the victory points from 3 sources:<br/> - Number of remaining city guards,<br/> - Number of damages on your boss<br/> - Achievements (drawn randomly at the beginning of the game).<br/><br/>INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PLAYERS<br/><br/>In this game, each player has his own path and city. But, players must manage with the other players by destroying their towers, sending them monsters, reaching achievements before them, etc.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Guillaume Mazoyer"], "categories": ["Medieval", "Territory Building"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Age of Towers", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 75, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 8.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 1}, "214993": {"mechanics": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management"], "usersrated": 5, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3294508.jpg", "wishing": 6, "owned": 101, "trading": 0, "id": 214993, "yearpublished": 2016, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 4, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3294508_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Dan Verssen Games (DVG)"], "families": [], "description": "Each Expansion expands the game and focuses on a specific aspect of the war.

Filled with various monsters, you must collect supplies and weapons to fight your way through the night. Can you survive until dawn? Can you escape the horrors of the town? Fight through asylums, schools, the meat factory and other horrific places as monsters hunt you. Build barricades, help other survivors for supplies. Kick doors down and fight for survival. Will you be the hunted, or the hunter?<br/><br/>Set in the 1980's and like a classic horror movie there are dozens of survival horror weapons to choose from but are you lucky and brave enough to find them?<br/><br/>Choose your survivors, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Each with their own unique skills and starting weapon. Work alone or fight together and try to resist the madness that is slowly turning your survivor into another monster.<br/><br/>The game is played on a D12 (12 sided dice).  Standard melee attacks are 5+ to hit but some survivors have better melee skills. Shooting is standard 5+ too. There is no shooting distance negative. Each survivor gets 5 actions for things like movement, shooting, building barricades etc.  There are dozens of weapons but only 1 and some 2 of each scattered around found in crates and given by in game story survivor's on successful missions. Plus most melee weapons breaks after an 10 uses and most monsters require 3-4 hits each so stocking up is Essential. There is also limited ammo supplies to be found. You can build special weapons too like a spear if you have tape, knife and a pole cue.  Most weapons and supplies are found in crates around the map. Break them open and take the said amount from the equipment card pile.<br/><br/>Helping in game survivors can gain you more weapons. Read the story card objective the survivor has task you with and complete in a certain amount of turns. Failing will result in the in game survivor turning mad. You then have the fight him. Killing him you can then take his supplies found on him but you will not get the crate of good stuff as he never told your where it was located.<br/><br/>Standard game is 10 missions. Your survivors have a certain amount of wounds each, some have 18 other 23-28. Having a tougher survivor does not mean the are better, instead sacrificing wounds for better accuracy or agility to avoid taking hits.  The Paratrooper is excellent at shooting and tough as nails but he is not as fast at running but someone like the Actress has few wounds but is very agile meaning its easy for her to avoid taking hits plus she can hide easier is sneaking around avoiding those horrid beasts.<br/><br/>Some monsters require light to die so carrying a torch is ideal. Other are messed up real bad by fire and others have longer reach meaning they can attack your from further away and also ignore barricades by simple walking along the wall or roof.<br/><br/>The movement is played in inches. Some can move 4 inch per action or 5. You can not run past enemies if they are within 1 inch and others have long arms so even more difficult to run past.  The monsters are played by the game.<br/><br/>Starting the game you have 1 survivor and as time goes on you unlock more playable survivors as the story goes on and you can trade weapons etc with them if next to them.  Each player starts with 1 survivor and same goes, unlock more throughout the missions.<br/><br/>Each survivor has their standard attack without weapons but they can attack like head butt or kick etc for a more powerful or multiple target attack but have to roll higher on the D12.  They also have a sanity attack which is a special powerful attack. To get a sanity attack you must kill the enemy. Some require 12 kills other 16 etc.<br/><br/>Madness is a thing that slowly affect your survivor throughout the game. Collect Essene by killing monsters to slow your madness or find essence statues through the map.  Going mad puts your character in the mad room were you have to fight your own demons. In the mad room you don't use the weapons you have collected instead you take new cards for this 1 mission. Completing the mad room puts you back in the game with your prevous weapons, supplies. To lose to the madness means you characters becomes a monster and hunts your other survivors. He is now controlled by the game.<br/><br/>Over all the co-op or 1 player experience is a story game were after completing each small mission you have a few turns to roam and find supplies etc. Then you take another story card and your next objective begins to completing your over all mission of escaping and surviving until sunrise.<br/><br/>There are various difficulty modes. Easy mode grants you a shop which you can buy new weapons and weapon mods like a silencer, scope plus supplies. Money is spent via sanity and madness points. Spending madness increases your madness and sanity spends sanity points meaning you have to kill more monsters to get your sanity attack back.<br/><br/>Normal mode does not have the shop and Nightmare mode has more monsters and less weapons / supplies. There is also the serial killer mode which you play a killer. The problem is his madness degrades faster but you can choose to kill other survivors for a big halt or kill monsters for a small halt to the madness.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Vander McLeod"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Action / Dexterity", "Adventure", "Card Game", "Collectible Components", "Dice", "Exploration", "Fighting", "Horror", "Miniatures", "Zombies"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Foghorn Nightmare", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 2, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 10.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "211995": {"mechanics": ["Player Elimination", "Role Playing", "Voting"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 211995, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 18, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "", "publishers": ["(Unknown)", "Apple"], "families": ["Werewolf / Mafia"], "description": "This game is a chinese version of Mafia / Werewolf.<br/><br/>There are a judge and 8~16 players in this game. <br/>The players consist of Civilians, Killers and Policemen. <br/>The number of Policemen and Killers depends on the total number of players. <br/>8~10 players: 2 Policemen and 2 Killers. <br/>11~14 players: 3 Policemen and 3 Killers. <br/>15~16 players: 4 Policemen and 4 Killers.<br/><br/>Game Goal Policemen: find out Killers and lead Civilians to vote Killers out of the game.

In some cases, this might be by doing good works or engaging in meaningful prayer, but in the darkest of times, indulgences were sold to anyone willing to make a significant &quot;contribution&quot;. As the rising families of the Italian Renaissance conspired and plotted to seize control, the indulgence offered a clear conscience for many a questionable deed committed in the name of power.<br/><br/>Indulgence is a trick-taking game for 3-4 players. On their turn, players choose an edict that gives the rule for the hand. The other players then decide if they want to violate the edict by doing the opposite of what it commands. So &quot;Don&rsquo;t take any Medicis&quot; suddenly becomes &quot;I must take all the Medicis&quot;. Committing a sin can be challenging, but a player attempting it gets the benefit of the indulgence, a token that turns one of their cards into a winning hand. Can you trick your opponents into committing sins without the indulgence? Can you avoid sinning yourself? Whoever can pull that off will end up with a pile of gems and the title of victor.<br/><br/>Ingulgence is a restoration of Dragonmaster, originally published by Milton Bradley in 1981 and designed by Jerry D'Arcey. It was itself a reimagining of D'Arcey's prior game, Coup d'Etat, and its classic progenitor Barbu. Dragonmaster enjoyed lavish production, with oversized cards, art by the incomparable Bob Pepper, and some nifty interlocking gems for keeping score. In addition to the retheming, the restoration evens out the game play. The original game suffered from a runaway leader problem in which an early power play with the dragon card all but assured one player's elimination from contention and gave the other a big leg up. The indulgence token replaces the dragon card to make it more accessible, less powerful, and easier to understand. It also increases the number of contracts from 5 to 20, and ups the deck to 36 cards.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["G.

Frantic bets placed in secret even as the cars race around the track. And to the victor, the biggest purse of all. But in the world of motor racing, the margin between victory and defeat can be a single moment: a steep banked turn, tires screaming and spitting out smoke, and the downforce, pressing you down in your seat and keeping you on the track as you make your move inside to pull ahead.<br/><br/>Downforce is a card-driven bidding, racing, and betting game for 2-6 players based on Top Race, the award-winning design by the legendary Wolfgang Kramer. Players first bid to own the six cars in the race, then they play cards from their hand to speed them around the track. However, most cards will also move their opponents' cars. So figuring out just the right time to play a card is the key to victory. Along the way, players make secret bets on who they think will win the race. Whoever has the most money from their prize money, winning bets, and remaining bank wins.<br/><br/>This is a game whose design needed no attention. Years of play and multiple versions have honed it to near perfection. On the contrary, one of the design challenges was figuring which of the many rules modules to incorporate to create the most fun version. Downforce also adds variable player powers to improve replayability. But mostly, it improves the look of the game to make it gorgeous and easy to play.

Get enough reward money, and you can finally leave this rat race behind and retire to a sunny tropical beach in the Caribbean.<br/><br/>Stop Thief is a family game of logical deduction for 2-4 players. An invisible suspect commits a crime. Only the sounds they make give them away. Listen to the clues and figure out where they are hiding. Play cards from your unique deck to move around the board, sneak through a window, or even get a private tip. Once you have the suspect pinned down, swoop in and make the arrest.<br/><br/>The obvious first step in this restoration was taking the electronic device and turning it into an app. Doing that allows for better sound quality and a more dynamic platform for different modes of play. Next step was ditching the roll-and-move mechanism and, in general, stripping out some of the luck and adding in a healthy dose of strategy. By replacing the dice with decks of movement cards, it also allows asymmetrical decks, which increases the fun and replayability.

You won't kill me out of some misplaced sense of self -righteousness, and I won't kill you because you are to much fun. I think you and I are destined to do this forever? - The Joker<br/><br/>The Joker is one of Batman's oldest and greatest foes. A mirror of the Bat himself, the Joker stands for everything Batman is against. Chaos, disorder and crime without reason.<br/><br/>Possibly one of Batman's greatest failures when the Red Hood fell into a vat of chemicals, the Joker has plagued Batman, his allies and Gotham City ever since.<br/><br/>Nobody knows who he really is and even the Joker himself has told several different origin stories. If he's going to have one, he would prefer it to be multiple choice.<br/><br/>Seeing murder, chaos and his 'dance' with Batman as one big joke, the Joker is one of the most dangerous men Batman has ever faced. Using countless resources including his own Joker Gas, he tries to take down Gotham and 'Batsy' again and again. Only to end up each time in Arkham Asylum.<br/><br/>During one stay in Arkham, the Joker met Dr. Harleen Quinzel. A psychiatrist that developed an obsession with the Joker that led her to become Harley Quinn and follow her 'puddin' on his journey of insanity.<br/><br/>Some of the Jokers worst crimes include paralysing Barbara Gordon / Batgirl and killing Batman's own sidekick Jason Todd / Robin. Batman has sworn not to kill, but can the Joker push him over the edge?<br/><br/>Using a Joker crew in the Batman Miniatures Game is to bring chaos to the table.<br/><br/>A dangerous man in his own right with weapons like a poisoned knife, one shot gun and explosive teeth, the Jokers true strength comes from his ability to change his crews plans at the last minute with the use of Kaos Agent. This means your opponent can never really know what you are going to do until it's too late.<br/><br/>Having Harley Quinn as a Sidekick can help with the mass chaos as she can even change your opponents plans while her True Love for the Joker means she can become very dangerous if her 'puddin' is taken down. Or if you need some muscle instead, Mr Hammer is happy to help.<br/><br/>The Jokers Clown Henchmen are very basic fighters all armed with a range of different weapons. They are easy to take down one by one, but being cheap to hire, there can be enough on the table to pull off any crime. There are also a few Elite Clowns if you want some Henchmen that are a bit more resilient and hit harder.<br/><br/>The Joker crew has access to all sorts of Free Agents to help them out. Killer Croc adds some serious muscle to the crew when it's needed and is quick to move around to where he is needed via the sewers. Scarecrow can help keep the insanity under control while also messing with the opponents plans further by forcing models to activate first.<br/><br/>Overall, the Joker crew is great for anyone to play. Kaos Agent makes it easy on new players while messing with your opponents plans can be fun for more experienced players.<br/><br/>Contains:<br/><br/>4 metal miniatures:<br/>- Joker<br/>- Clown<br/>- Ringmaster<br/>- Contra-Auguste<br/>Stat cards for the characters<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": [], "categories": ["Comic Book / Strip", "Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Batman Miniature Game: Joker's Crew", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "215320": {"mechanics": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Dice Rolling", "Variable Player Powers"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3302876.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 215320, "yearpublished": 2012, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3302876_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Knight Models"], "families": ["Comics: DC Universe"], "description": "&quot;Ahh... the Batman.

If you want a weapon, he has it. Want someone taken care of, he knows the perfect person to call.<br/><br/>Cobblepot started life teased as a child because of his short stature and bird-like nose earning him the nickname 'penguin' and when his father died of pneumonia, his mother made him carry an umbrella wherever he went which did not help with the rest of the worlds view of him. This led to Oswald becoming a nasty, resentful person that wanted to prove he could be better than those around him while he was growing up.<br/><br/>Cobblepot has a genius level intellect, amazing business sense, he's a tactical mastermind, oddly skilled fighter for his build and has obsessions with birds and his trusty umbrellas.<br/><br/>All of this has made him into the Penguin that now runs most of the crime in Gotham.<br/><br/>The Penguin can out-plan and out-think his opponents with ease but if things ever go wrong he has an entire arsenal of trick umbrellas to fall back on. Everything from guns and grapples to gas, hypnosis and even one that can fly.<br/><br/>His plans, schemes and crimes are often run using money from his legitimate businesses like the Iceberg Lounge and Iceberg Casino. If he needs help, he won't shy away from hiring the best in the world but only if he thinks he will come out better off in the end.<br/><br/>In the Batman Miniatures Game, the Penguin crew is all about money, resources and using them as best as you can to get the job done.<br/><br/>Oswald himself much more dangerous than he looks. Armed with an Umbrella Cannon and Umbrella Blade, he can dish out a lot of damage when he needs to and even has a bulletproof vest under his fine jacket for extra protection. He real strength though is getting his crew and others to do the work for him.<br/><br/>Penguin is Charismatic and a Lord of Business so can hire more Free Agents than most, better equip his own men and even take extra Loot Objectives.<br/><br/>The Penguin thugs are cheap but that also makes them numerous. Throw enough men at a problem and it can be solved. The Penguins extra equipment reserves let him arm his hordes well though. Assault Rifles, Automatic Guns and Grenades are not uncommon to see in the middle of the Thugs.<br/><br/>If the hulking Sickle joins him as a Sidekick, he can also bring along some more Elite Penguin Thugs when the extra skill is wanted.<br/><br/>Instead of hordes of Thugs, Penguin also has the options of hiring almost any Free Agent he needs with his Charisma and $$$ letting him choose people like Deadshot and Deathstroke on a regular basis as deadly assassins.<br/><br/>A couple of very good choices though are Catwoman and Mr Freeze. Freeze adds to the ranged threat of the well armed crew while Catwoman can jump around when your opponent is dealing with all the Thugs. Both also have Loot on their mind so the Penguins extra Loot Objective can help you bump up your VPs.<br/><br/>Overall, a Penguin crew is about strength in numbers. Either the number of bodies you have at your disposal or the number of deadly weapons and skilled assassins you throw at your opponent.<br/><br/>A great starting crew with several options and ways to play for the more experienced players.<br/><br/>Contains:<br/>4 metal miniatures:<br/>- Penguin<br/>- Penguin Emperor<br/>- Royal Penguin<br/>- Blue Penguin<br/>Stat cards for the characters<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": [], "categories": ["Comic Book / Strip", "Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Batman Miniature Game: Penguin's Crew", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "215327": {"mechanics": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "usersrated": 1, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3307706.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 3, "trading": 0, "id": 215327, "yearpublished": 2016, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3307706_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Unknown)"], "families": [], "description": "A board game for people who are interested in being startup superheroes, changing the world, and becoming billionaires.

Each player starts with a basic deck of cards that they can use to purchase, or upgrade to, other, more powerful cards. Thunderstone Quest brings new play modes to the table. The game will tell a specific story with a series of pre-set dungeon tiles, monsters, heroes and support cards. Each will come with a series of mini-adventures and a story booklet that tells players what happens as they progress through the scenarios.<br/><br/>Once players have completed the quests they will be able to enjoy great replay value with the available selection of monsters, heroes, and support cards, as well as the new dungeon tiles, by choosing random set-ups before the start of play. Aside from heroes such as wizards, fighters, rogues, and clerics, cards will include supplies that heroes need like weapons, spells, items, or light to reach further into the dungeon.<br/><br/>The dungeon deck is created by combining several different groups of monsters together. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different hero types, so players have to take this into account when they choose what to buy.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Mike Elliott", "Bryan Reese", "Mark Wootton"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Fantasy"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Thunderstone Quest", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 80, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 9.7, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.458258, "numcomments": 6}, "215342": {"mechanics": ["Co-operative Play"], "usersrated": 1, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3315324.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 7, "trading": 0, "id": 215342, "yearpublished": 2016, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3315324_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Sensible Object"], "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "description": "Meet Lalnalion, a very special beast whom you might just recognise&hellip; Inspired by The Yogscast&rsquo;s very own Duncan Jones, the Lalnalion Artefact introduces a strange and wonderful new menagerie of over 40 hybrid Yogs-flavoured beasts for you to discover and add to your Bestiary!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Tim Burrell-Saward"], "categories": ["Action / Dexterity", "Animals", "Collectible Components", "Electronic", "Expansion for Base-game", "Party Game"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Beasts of Balance: The Lalnalion", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "216798": {"mechanics": ["Line Drawing", "Paper-and-Pencil"], "usersrated": 2, "image": "", "wishing": 1, "owned": 9, "trading": 0, "id": 216798, "yearpublished": 2014, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 1, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "", "publishers": ["USAopoly"], "families": [], "description": "This is the family sized (4-6) player version of Telestrations.

The attack by the 78th Division interrupted Hitler's plans for the northern shoulder of the Bulge.<br/><br/>The recent release of Battle of the Twin Villages got your boots into the snow.

And that means the height of ferocity of Hitler's last gamble, aka 'Wacht Am Rhein' has been unleashed. And every village, every road crossing, where a stand is made can make the difference between a drive to Antwerp, or a final, crushing blow to the tyrant's dreams as he hunkers in his lair.

Players are khans of different fantastical tribes on the Plains of Prax, each riding a unique animal that confers special abilities. Everyone attempts to amass the biggest herd, meanwhile fighting off enemy magic, stampedes and attempts by other players to steal their cows.<br/><br/>Each player chooses a Khan to play, and receives a set number of corral tiles (depending on the number of players in the game). Each Khan has a different special ability. For example, the Morokanth player gets one extra Corral tile, and the High Llama player can sneak one cow card into each of their corrals after the gate has been closed.<br/><br/>Players take turns to raid different locations, drawing cards from 10 different stacks. Each stack contains the cards, in random order: 1 x 100, 2 x 50 and 1 x 20 Cows, a Stampede card (discard highest value cow card), an Enemy Magic card (discard all cow cards), a Tribal Champion card (protects against Enemy Magic), and a Waha's Blessing card worth 20 cows, which a player can swap for another player's Cow card.<br/><br/>Each players' cow cards are placed face-up in front them as their herd. Instead of drawing, on their turn a player can corral their cows. Corralled cows are safe, but each corral can only be opened once in a game. Uncorraled cows count towards the final score at the end of the game, but remain at risk of Stampedes, Enemy Magic and Waha's Blessings. Because each player has a limited number of corrals, a key element of the game is deciding when to corral them. The player with the most cows&mdash;including those in corrals and in their herd&mdash;at the end of the game is the winner and acclaimed &quot;Khan of Khans&quot;.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Reiner Knizia"], "categories": ["Animals", "Card Game", "Fantasy", "Print & Play"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Khan of Khans", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 25, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.66667, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 2.0548, "numcomments": 2}, "215615": {"mechanics": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 215615, "yearpublished": 1989, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "", "publishers": ["Bandai (\u30d0\u30f3\u30c0\u30a4)"], "families": [], "description": "One of the oldest board games series &quot;Gundam&quot;, for 2 to 5 people. the SD Gundam was so popular that it became the third piece in the SD Gundam Series of the Patio.

The more you get play it, the more advanced formations you and your opponent will come up with. <br/>Through different tactics and different setups, you will delve into the over 14.000 different ways to set up your army.<br/><br/>Though playing it gives a similar vibe, Edge is not Magic or even a rework of the game. No more arguing about obscure rules or different versions of the same. This game combines elements and inspiration from multiple games, that most gamers will recognize, but the mechanics are utilized in such a way that the game forms it's own new genre.<br/><br/>So choose your tactics and strategy!<br/>How will you choose to play and how will you ensure victory? Do you want to charge at your opponent with brute force, or do you want to slowly lure him into your traps to weaken him before the deathblow. The choice is yours.<br/><br/>Goal of the Game<br/>Most points win!<br/>So in the normal game you will need to accumulate more points then your opponent in a 2 matchs/battles setup.<br/>There are variants but even for those most points win<br/><br/>Resources<br/>This game as stated in the game concept, is about resources. your card/pawns, dices, re-rolls and everything else is a limited resource and you will need to think about when and when not to use them or you will quickly find yourself with any way to protect your army and lose.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Malthe Guldagger Lund"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Dice", "Mythology", "Print & Play"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Edge: Clans of Icosara", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "215803": {"mechanics": ["Auction/Bidding", "Memory", "Partnerships"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3297241.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "trading": 0, "id": 215803, "yearpublished": 2016, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3297241_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Sumizome Sakura (\u58a8\u67d3\u685c)"], "families": [], "description": "User summary<br/>\u30d1\u30ca\u30de (Panama) is a investment card game for 4 players only, which uses a deck of traditional playing cards and 20 card stands made with a 3D printer. The rules are available in Japanese and English. (In Japan, the standard deck of Western playing cards is known as a 'Trump' deck. Hence the designer explaining the game as a 'Trump Extension' game.)<br/><br/>Cards numbered A, 2, 3, 4, 5, and two jokers are investment cards. Five cards each are dealt to the players. Cards numbered 6-10 are tax haven cards. Players try to earn positive tax haven cards by playing investing cards.<br/><br/>When you invest on a tax haven card, you place a card stand along a border of the tax haven card and insert an investment card you want to play, so that one player cannot see how much you invest. Up to four players can invest on a tax haven card, and the highest investor earns the face value of that tax haven card. But one pre-determined suit counts negative, and a joker also inverts the sign if involved. You should speculate about hidden cards and try to let negative points go to other investors.<br/><br/>You can co-operate with one of other players by sharing complete information about what you play. But to win the game, you have to part ways in the end.<br/><br/>Jacks, Queens, and King are agent card.

You can pay the jewel cost (earned from rolling dice), and that crew member is now part of your crew. You will play that Crew Card on the table in front of you. A new Crew Card replaces the drafted Crew Card on the table. - Each crew member has attributes which will help players complete Heists. Some crew members have special abilities which will improve your abilities, or hinder the play of your competitors.<br/><br/>Completing Heists &ndash; If you have enough attributes from your collective Crew Cards, you may complete the Heists. The Heist requirements are detailed at the bottom of the Heist Card. You will add your Crew Card attributes together, and if those attributes total to at least the minimum required for each Heist requirement, you may complete the Heist. You will take the Heist card and keep it on the table in front of you. A new Heist Card is placed face up on the table to replace any Heist Card taken by a player. Each Heist Card has a Notoriety point value at the top right.

Dinosaurs still roam the Earth &amp; magic actually works! A sub-species of early Humans called Neuro-Evolutionary Rostral Developers (abbreviated as N.E.R.D.s) has recently evolved, &amp; N.E.R.D.s have been busy inventing all sorts of amazing &ldquo;cavepunk&rdquo; stuff.<br/><br/>One of their most popular inventions is the downhill racer, popularly known as the Whee in Cave-Speak. Many different styles of Whees have been invented, &amp; the N.E.R.D.s who invent them almost always claim their design is the best.<br/><br/>A bunch of prehistoric Clans have gotten together to test these claims. The Great Whee Race is about to begin! Each player chooses a Whee Racer, &amp; then purchases a Crew &amp; Cavepunk inventions. The racers then vie to be the first to cross the finish line in a race down a big hill. And just about anything goes in The Great Whee Race, so you&rsquo;ll have to outmaneuver, outfight, &amp; outwit your opponents in order to win!<br/><br/>The Great Whee Race is played on a track overlaid with a square grid. From 2 to 5 racers vie to make it to the finish line first. Each racer - called a Whee in Cave-Speak - is controlled by 1 player (or team of players), A variety of prehistoric-ish species serve as crew members, &amp; give various bonuses. Whees can be outfitted with melee weapons, missile weapons, or both, as well as cavepunk inventions.<br/><br/>Once the downhill journey begins, a simple card-based simultaneous movement &amp; action system is used so that players don&rsquo;t know where anyone else is going when they choose their movement. This has 2 nice effects: players are all active throughout most of each turn, &amp; perhaps more importantly, there are usually LOTS of collisions.<br/><br/>A unique &ldquo;game mechanic&rdquo; is used to resolve all actions: the Rok Draw. Every time they attempt an action or have a contest with another player, a player draws from a pool of tokens consisting of 3 kinds of Roks.

After being lost for centuries, you now have a chance at learning about the heart of that mythic civilization! Choose your character and begin your adventure into the wilds! But watch out! The curse which brought Ilkannon to ruin is still housed within its walls! Restore the city - but make sure you don&rsquo;t unleash corruption upon the world!<br/><br/>You play one of four characters: An adventurer, a politician, a scholar, or a mechanic. Each person has their own goals within the city, and each one has their own faults that make them susceptible to various curses. The ultimate end goal is to find four power crystals to revitalize the city or to find one item to bring back to tell of their great discovery!<br/><br/>There are four main stats which each character has: Corruption Resistance, Movement, Restoration, and Ingenuity.  Corruption Resistance is how susceptible a character is to the dark forces still at work in Ilkannon.  This is used mostly during events.  Movement is how far the character can move on their turn.  Restoration is how many tiles a character can restore on their turn.  Ingenuity is used for events, and is based on how well the character deals with certain situations outside of their normal state.  Corruption Resistance and Ingenuity affect how many dice the character rolls during certain events.<br/><br/>The city of Ilkannon is composed of sixteen tiles, laid out in a grid of four by four.

One player - the &quot;subject&quot; of a monstrological investigation - randomly and secretly selects an imaginary monster from the deck of monster cards.<br/><br/>2. The subject fills out a &quot;taxonomy board&quot; in order to give the other players (the &quot;investigators&quot;) a sense of his or her monster.  The subject cannot communicate with the other players in any other way - no facial expressions or hand gestures!<br/><br/>3. The subject places his or her monster in a lineup with other imaginary monsters (i.e. more cards).<br/><br/>4. The investigators attempt to deduce which monster belongs to the subject. Lively discussion ensues as the investigators attempt to convince each other that &quot;this monster looks like he'd prefer flies to gerbils&quot;, or &quot;are you kidding? that monster would be terrible at babysitting!&quot;<br/><br/>5. The more investigators who select the correct monster, the more points the team scores.<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Andy Lubershane"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Deduction", "Fantasy", "Party Game", "Science Fiction"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Monstrology", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 180, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 10.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "211962": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 5, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3232141.png", "wishing": 41, "owned": 16, "trading": 0, "id": 211962, "yearpublished": 2016, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 6, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3232141_t.png", "publishers": ["Hobby Japan"], "families": [], "description": "In \u305f\u305f\u3089\u3070\u3068\u68ee (Tatara, Field, and Forest), each player represents a Toryo clan engaged in the production of tatara steel with the long-term goal of allowing for perpetual production &mdash; but to do this, the players must learn to coexist with the forest of Okuizumo or else that won't be able to fire up their tatara.<br/><br/>During the game, players plant trees and harvest other trees that were already on the board.

Any number of decisions or events could have altered the outcome, and 'To The Last Extremity' gives players the chance to see what might have been.&quot; --from the rule book.<br/><br/>In To The Last Extremity the forces of the fledgling United States of America, consisting of Continental Army infantry and artillery, local militia, and allied Oneida Indian units, face off against the besieging forces consisting of British Army infantry and artillery, Hessian J&auml;gers, Canadian militia, and American Indian allies. Each side receives a deck of cards representing its military forces and the various leaders instrumental in the campaign, such as the American commander, Col. Peter Gansevoort, and the British commander, Brig. Gen. Barry St. Leger, plus many others (including American Indian leaders and Benedict Arnold before he turned traitor!).<br/><br/>Players face off on opposite sides of a period map of the area surrounding Fort Stanwix. At the beginning of each turn, the American player will roll to see if a Chance card is drawn. Chance cards introduce historical events into the game and their effects on one or both sides. The rule book has detailed historical descriptions of each event, which are informational only, but help to bring the history and drama of the Siege of Fort Stanwix to life. Following a possible Chance card draw, players will secretly assign forces and leaders to each of the four sides of Fort Stanwix: north, south, east, and west. How the players choose to distribute their forces will determine the outcome of the siege. Players then reveal their cards. If the British have assigned forces to assault one or more sides of the fort, players will compare the strengths of the opposing forces on that side and roll a die to determine the resultant casualties and whether a breach of the fortress walls has occurred. If the British achieve two breaches on the same turn, they have taken the fort and win the game. If, after 13 turns, the British fail to take the fort, the outnumbered Americans have broken the siege and have defeated the British.<br/><br/>On each turn, the British may also elect to dig entrenchments to protect their artillery, or bombard or skirmish with sides of the fort to effect American morale.<br/><br/>Easily playable in under an hour, &quot;To The Last Extremity&quot; is a simple wargame that provides a great deal of historical flavor surrounding one of the earliest American victories achieved in U.S. history.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Allan D.

There were two gods &mdash; the god of the sea and the god of the mountains &mdash; who created the world, but each loved their own creations more than anything else, so they came into conflict.<br/><br/>In Minimal Creation (a.k.a. \u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u5275\u4e16\u8a18), players are these two gods and to end their conflict, they each decide to send one of their followers deep into the other's territory to steal a relic that sits there. Over the course of the game, you lay terrain tiles on the game board to expand your territory and lead your follower, moving it along the terrain to the opponent's temple in which the relic lies. The opponent loses a lot of victory points if you successfully steal their relic, but you also need to place tiles to accumulate small points along the way. How much effort you commit on expanding territory and stealing the relic will determine the outcome of the game.<br/><br/>When a follower successfully reaches the opponent's temple, the temple is removed and the game ends. If you have made any 2x2 squares of your territory, each square is worth one point. The temple is worth eight points if not removed.

The game is about achieving a common goal together with an alliance while reviewing and discussing the 17 Success Principles written by Dr. Napoleon Hill (author of the classic book Think and Grow Rich). When the alliance collects more than 2,000 PMA (Positive Mental Attitude) points together they win the game by accomplishing the highest achievement level. If a player in the alliance loses all of his or her 11 Opportunity Time Tokens the game ends for the alliance. As a result, the players compare their alliance&rsquo;s PMA (Positive Mental Attitude) point total with a range of achievement levels.<br/><br/>This Achievus board game base set includes two games in one, &ldquo;Achievus Junior&rdquo; A.K.A. &ldquo;Achievus Mind-Set&rdquo; (2 to 4 players, Ages 7+) and &ldquo;Achievus Original&rdquo; A.K.A. &ldquo;Achievus Challenge&rdquo; (1 to 4 players, Ages 14+).

A player takes his or her turn by following these 5 steps;<br/><br/>Step 1) Draw Step - Draw up to 6 cards, if needed.<br/>Step 2) Call Step - Call out a card to a player for a possible match.<br/>Step 3) Give &amp; Take Step - Give and Take a card with a player.<br/>Step 4) Play Step - May play down any needed pairs for the player&rsquo;s collection of the 17 principles,<br/>Step 5) Redraw Step - Redraw up to 6 cards.<br/><br/>If the players don&rsquo;t have a match during Step 2 then the calling player will lose one of his 11 Opportunity Time Tokens. When it&rsquo;s a match both players add the needed principle card to his or her collection of 17 principle cards. Then they read the principle meaning from the card aloud and discuss it with their alliance. The goal of Achievus Junior is for each player to help one another to collect a card of all 17 principles, without losing all of his or her Opportunity Time Tokens. Only then will the players earn the Golden Rule Applied Tokens, the ultimate achievement of the game.<br/><br/>Achievus Original &ndash; Game Play Overview<br/><br/>While Playing Achievus Original, players will experience prosperity and adversity events throughout the game, earning PMA points and Action Stars. All players&rsquo; follow these 6 consecutive steps together, each step before the next, to complete a round of play.<br/><br/>Step 1) Draw Step - Each player draws five cards, resolving any adversity or prosperity events.<br/>Step 2) Sacrifice Step - Each player may or may not choose to sacrifice his turn, discarding his cards and losing only one Opportunity Time Token this way.<br/>Step 3) Collect Step - Each player may choose to collect the cards they have previously played in their Conscious Mind Section to earn PMA points and Action Stars or may choose to continue gathering without collecting at this time. <br/>Step 4) Play Step - Each player plays his or her cards in consecutive order in any players&rsquo; Conscious Mind Section, earning PMA points for giving.<br/>Step 5) Missed Opportunity Step - Each player loses one of his or her 11 Opportunity Time Tokens for each principle card not played then discards them.<br/>Step 6) Read Step &ndash; Read the top discarded principle card.

On Saturday nights, the factory comes to life as the ultimate race course with treacherous obstacles and rival sabotage. In Robo Rally, players move their robots through the course by speeding through corridors and dodging traps to reach each checkpoint first. Only the strongest robots survive!<br/><br/>Enter the world of mad machines and dangerous schemes in the Robo Rally board game. Players control their robot with game cards which reveal directions on how the robots can move through the hectic Robo Rally automobile factory. Use strategy to outsmart rival robots while racing towards each checkpoint in your chosen course in numerical order. Beware of factory obstacles such as industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyer belts that can make or break the race.<br/><br/>The 2016 edition of Robo Rally differs from earlier versions in a number of ways:<br/><br/><br/>    Players each now have their own deck of twenty cards, with the same cards in each deck. On a turn, a player draws nine cards from their deck, programs five of the cards, then discards the rest. Two cards says &quot;Again&quot; and repeat the action programmed in the previous slot; one card says &quot;Energy&quot; and gives a energy cube which you can use to buy options.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Since each player has their own deck, the cards no longer have priority numbers to determine who moves first. Now movement order is determined by whoever is closest to a transmitter on the game board.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Players start with a hand of three option cards and five energy. Each option card has an energy cost, and you can purchase additional option cards for the cost of two energy each. Players can earn energy by programming it, by being the first to a pitstop, or by starting their turn on a pitstop.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    When players are damaged, they no longer receive one less card for each damage (or have one of their program registers locked) at the start of a round; instead they receive damage cards that will be shuffled into their decks. &quot;Normal&quot; damage from the board or a robot laser gives you &quot;spam&quot; damage. When you program one of these cards, you remove it from play at the appropriate time and replace it in the register with the top card from your deck. Surprise! Other types of damage exist, with a Trojan horse granting you two spam, a virus infecting nearby players, and a worm forcing you to reboot, which gives you even more damage.

It is also available for download via Wargame Vault for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>It is based on one of the early battles of the Thirty Years War, the Battle of White Mountain. One sheet of rules and one mapsheet is provided; you'll need to provide twelve dice and 50 tokens, coins, or cubes.<br/><br/>Each player has a pool of dice that he rolls each turn, and then he commits dice to a particular unit's box, according to the type and number of dice that can be placed in that box. For example, the Bohemian Right and his opponent's Catholic League Infantry both use sixes, but the latter can gain at most one die per turn. It's not that the Bohemians are more ferocious or better-led (they're not!), but rather that they are fighting (albeit poorly) from a strong defensive position, while mounting an attack on that position takes time and preparation. When a unit is activated, all the stored dice are removed, and losses are inflicted on the enemy depending on the number of dice.<br/><br/>Or not; one of the signal features of this particular design is the ability of cavalry and artillery to screen and discourage enemy attacks. If I have the right number of dice in my cavalry box when you attack an infantry unit under that cavalry's protection, I can expend those dice to cancel your attack. In fact, it's not just that I can do it, but that I'm required to, and so both the attacking unit and the screening unit have their dice cleared out. When I perform that Reaction, it robs me of the ability to make an Attack on my own turn immediately following. This means that there's a definite cat-and-mouse feel, with each side struggling for control of tempo. You don't want to just prevent your enemy from attacking, you also want to get the leverage you need to launch a successful attack yourself. You want to set up your cavalry so as to screen effectively, but if that's all you're doing, you won't have sufficient dice to press your advantage when it appears.<br/><br/>In general, the Imperial/Catholic League position is a more flexible one, representative of the superiority of their commanders and the bifurcated command structure. Not only may they place in two boxes per turn (one per army), but between them there's at least one box that can potentially utilize each die result. The Bohemian Player on the other hand places in only one box per turn, and any ones, twos, or threes are absolutely worthless. Because of his defensive position, he can place more dice for his infantry divisions - if you roll three sixes, you can place three sixes, while the enemy infantry places at most one at a time.<br/><br/>So, each side has its strengths and weaknesses, and while your decisions are driven by your dice, they are still meaningful decisions. The game typically plays out in less than thirty minutes, with the exact time depending on the aggressiveness of the players.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Tom Russell"], "categories": ["Pike and Shot", "Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Christmas at White Mountain", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 8.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "216301": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 3, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3326508.jpg", "wishing": 4, "owned": 1, "trading": 0, "id": 216301, "yearpublished": 2017, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3326508_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"], "families": [], "description": "Welcome back to London where the champions of Scotland Yard are once again on the hunt for the invisible Mister X!<br/><br/>At the beginning of Scotland Yard: Das Kartenspiel, an implementation of the evergreen title Scotland Yard, the Mister X card is randomly distributed to one of the players.

Howard, is a scenario-based semi-cooperative asymmetric miniatures board game. One player is the Opponent, playing the Opposition forces, and the other players (1 to 4) play Conan and his companions: Shevatas the thief, Hadrathus the Priest/Sorcerer, Belit the pirate queen, Valeria the warrior, etc. The game is based purely on Robert E. Howard's novels and short stories (and not the movies or other non-Howardian material). The publisher has hired Patrice Louinet, a Howard expert, to make sure the art and the scenarios are compatible with Howard's vision.<br/><br/>Each game is a scenario, played on a map. There will be several maps &mdash; Pictish Village, Underground temple, Tavern, Pirate ship, etc. &mdash; and each map can have several scenarios set on it. The game is fast, one hour approximately. It's possible to play several scenarios in a campaign, but you can also play each scenario individually. There will be a dozen playable scenarios in the base box.<br/><br/>At the beginning of a scenario, players choose their team (Conan and two or three other heroes). The Opponent gathers all the miniatures (picts, Necromancer, skeleton warriors, monsters, etc.), tokens, cards from the chosen scenario. The game usually plays in a limited number of turns (ten, for instance). Each scenario can have very different objectives: find the princess captured by picts and hidden in a hut and leave the camp before the pict hunters return; find the magical key to open a sealed door, steal the jewel and leave; kill the Necromancer by the end of turn 10; survive by the end of turn 10; escape the prison; etc.<br/><br/>During their turn, the heroes can activate or rest. If they activate, they can spend &quot;gems&quot; from their energy pool to do all sorts of actions: move, fight (melee or distance), defend, pick a lock, reroll, etc. If they rest, they can move a lot of gems from their &quot;spent&quot; pool box to their &quot;available&quot; pool box. When they take an action, they throw a number of dice equal to the number of gems they put in their action. There are three different kinds of dice: yellow (the weaker dice), orange (medium) and red (strong). Each character has a color based on their specialty: Conan throws red dice in combat while the Sorcerer throws yellow dice in combat; the thief throws red dice in Manipulation actions, while Conan throws orange dice; etc. Each player can have equipment cards (armor, magic potions, weapons, etc.) which give them bonuses on their dice rolls.<br/><br/>The Opponent plays differently. He uses a board with eight slidable tiles, plus his own Energy gems. Each tile corresponds to one unit (1 to 3 miniatures) on the game mat, and all of the miniature abilities are written on this tile (movement, armor, attack, special abilities). The tile position on the board corresponds to the numbers 1-8. The Opponent has a pool of energy gems and each time he activates one unit, he needs to spend a number of gems matching the tile placement: tile#1 costs 1 energy gem, tile#2 costs 2 gems, etc. Whatever tile the Opponent chooses to activate, he spends the corresponding energy cost (moving his energy gems from the available pool to the spent pool), then takes the tile out and moves it to the end of the sliding track: If he wants to activate this unit again, it will cost him 8 gems, because the unit is now on position 8. The Opponent can activate a maximum of two tiles, and he regains only a certain number of gems each turn (depending on the scenario).<br/><br/>In a typical scenario, the heroes need to accomplish something and the Opponent wins if the heroes fail to reach their objective &mdash; but in some scenarios, the Opponent has his own objectives and the Heroes win if they prevent him from accomplishing his goal.<br/><br/>Components (according to the back of the box):<br/><br/>     33 spell cards (actually 41 in French, 41 in English)<br/>     33 equipment cards (actually 29, 5 blanks, and 5 labeled A through E ---two sets of 39, in English and French)<br/>     61 tiles (actually 90, see below)<br/>     39 tokens<br/>     17 Hero sheets<br/>     1 scenario booklet (1 in French, 1 in English; 4 scenarios)<br/>     1 map board<br/>     6 dice<br/>     1 dice bag<br/>     1 map of Conan's world (single-sided, English only)<br/>     115 miniatures (plastic)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The tiles need to be looked at more closely. 29 come in English-French pairs, 16 are unique (meant to be used in either language: the Event tile, the two Pirates, and 13 Heroes), and 8 are non-lingual pairs (e.g. Conan, Thaug, Constantius, Slasher, etc.).

At first all of us were excited, because a silly string store was opening in town, and Sour John&rsquo;s dad was handing out free samples to all the kids in the mall.  We had a blast!  But the spoiled brat &ldquo;Sour John&rdquo;, as we would later come to call him, wasn&rsquo;t satisfied.  He wanted to rule the entire mall, and eventually all of Little Worth.  Sour John was a child genius, and he soon opened his own weapon store, &ldquo;More Gore!&rdquo;, in the mall.  This is where he conducted his late night experiments to perfect a can of silly string that would be unbreakable, unending, AND impossible to resist.  One night he went to the fountain in the greenery section of the mall, &ldquo;Fount Bloom&rdquo;, and discovered that Fount Bloom&rsquo;s special mixture was exactly what was needed to craft his most diabolical creation &ndash; &ldquo;ONE STRING TO RULE THE MALL!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Fortunately for us all, he misplaced The One String before he was able to wield it.  It was found by a good kid, nick-named &ldquo;Seagull&rdquo;, but it quickly corrupted him.  He started using The One String as deodorant and calling it &ldquo;my freshness&rdquo;.  (Yeah, it was weird.)  Seagull took up with the wrong kids, the &ldquo;Redheads&rdquo;, and later changed his name to &ldquo;Gold Thumb&rdquo; (based on his newfound obsession with the James Bond movie &ldquo;Goldfinger&rdquo;).  But again, as fate would have it, &ldquo;Billy Bob&rdquo; Braggin found The One String in Gold Thumb&rsquo;s discarded lunchbox, and he kept it safe for a while.  Most recently he just gifted it to his younger cousin, &ldquo;Fro-Gro&rdquo; Braggin.  But Sour John has just discovered that the Braggin family is in possession of The One String. He has dispatched his scariest goons, the &ldquo;Nostrils&rdquo;, with robes and skateboards of black, to retrieve The One String and bring it back to &ldquo;More Gore!&rdquo;<br/><br/>The two groups of good kids in Little Worth Mall, &ldquo;Yellow Ship&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lean &amp; Green&rdquo;, have just held a secret meeting at &ldquo;Livin&rsquo; Well&rdquo;, a natural supplement store owned by &ldquo;Spell Wand&rsquo;s&rdquo; parents.  They have decided that Yellow Ship will undertake the dangerous task of taking The One String all the way (downstairs) to Fount Bloom, the only place where it can be dissolved forever.  Meanwhile, Lean &amp; Green will serve as a distraction to keep the Redheads and the Nostrils away from The One String.  Secrecy is of the utmost importance.

Numerous French efforts to dislodge them failed and the two great hosts stared at each other from their respective trenches. German General Erich von Falkenhayn and French Marshal Joseph Joffre realized that there was much open, exploitable territory to the north of these solidified lines and each prepared to maneuver around the flanks of his opponent. These mutual and simultaneous flanking moves resulted in a series of headlong battles that gradually shifted the forces north toward the French Channel coast. These maneuverings yielded a series of encounter battles at Picardy, Albert, Artois, La Bassee and along the Yser River. But these engagements were ultimately indecisive and the campaign&rsquo;s final stage was set for the dramatic clash at the end of the &ldquo;race&rdquo;, at the ancient textile city of Ypres. <br/>The &ldquo;Race to the Sea&rdquo; campaign was the last mobile campaign on the western front of the First World War &ndash; a last chance for victory.

It was designed to be an add-on to Pyramid Arcade, but can be played with any Looney Pyramids and some six-sided dice.<br/><br/>RULES<br/><br/>The goal is to control three cities (circular spaces on board [but not including one's home city]) by arranging a stack of one's pyramids whose pip count is higher than every other players' stack (including dead ones) on that space.<br/><br/>SET UP: Each player gets three trios of pyramids, one color to a player, and pick which corner space to place their starting stack (called a spire, in tree formation) on. Spare pyramids are kept in a bank next to the player. Black pyramids are used to represent dead cities: unused spaces during set up and the remaining spires of players removed from the game. In a four-player game, the central space is a dead city (with its own spire). In two- and three-player games two opposing corners are dead cities.<br/><br/>PLAY: On one's turn roll the three dice and perform the three actions in any order. The options are: Transform: take a piece from one's spire and turn it into a sandship by placing it on its side in a city's port (triangular notch in circle); or, turn or add a sandship into a spire of yours in another city. Build: add a piece (using the smallest pieces first) to your home spire. Unfurl: replace a sandship with the next largest piece. Move: move a sandship to another port, either in the same city, or travel to a port of another city in the same zone. If there is already a sandship there of a smaller size it can be pushed to the next port in that city. Zap: remove a smaller piece from another player's spire using your sandship docked in that city. Wild: choose any of the other actions to perform. If you roll two-of-kind, one is treated as wild. If three-of-kind, two become wild with a bonus wild action. If an action cannot be performed treat the roll as wild.<br/><br/>If a player's home spire is completely zapped away all that player's sandships are removed and any of that person's spires in other cities are replaced with black pyramids.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Andrew Looney"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Sandships", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.3, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.4, "numcomments": 7}, "212806": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 1, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3276409.jpg", "wishing": 3, "owned": 5, "trading": 0, "id": 212806, "yearpublished": 2016, "maxplayers": 47, "numweights": 1, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3276409_t.jpg", "publishers": ["999 Games"], "families": ["Werewolf / Mafia"], "description": "For the first time in one box: base game + 3 expansions (new moon + characters + the village).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 8, "averageweight": 2.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Philippe des Palli\u00e8res", "Herv\u00e9 Marly"], "categories": ["Party Game"], "name": {"@sortindex": "4", "#text": "De Weerwolven Van Wakkerdam: Het Pact", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 40, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 9.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 1}, "212270": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 1, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3253618.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 5, "trading": 0, "id": 212270, "yearpublished": 2016, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3253618_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Kiehly"], "families": [], "description": "Shabono takes the players to the rain forest of Venezuela.<br/>The shaman of an Indigenous tribe plays with the village children the popular and traditional Shabono game.<br/><br/>The settlement of the villagers consists of a coherent ring of individual huts, called Shabono.

In each round, each player is once a shaman.<br/><br/>In the first round the players must collect coins of an animal motif.<br/><br/>In the second round, the players must collect coins from two different animal motifs. It can happen that two players have to collect the same animal motif.

It covers the campaigns of spring and autumn 1800 that took place in Germany from the crossing of the Rhine to the banks of the Inn. General Moreau, whose successes would later be overshadowed by those of Napoleon in Italy and the improbable victory of Marengo, is at the heart of this initiative. In six months, he manages to force back Kray&rsquo;s and then the Archduke John&rsquo;s Austrians from France&rsquo;s doorstep to the confines of Bavaria with the culminating decisive battle at Hohenlinden.<br/>The three first scenarios describe Moreau&rsquo;s entrance into the campaign with the hazardous crossing of the Rhine, the gruelling march through the Black Forest, the concentration of the three army corps from Sainte Suzanne, Saint Cyr and the army reserve coinciding with the flank assault from Lecourbe&rsquo;s corps, the counterattack of the Austrians under Kray, and the undecided battles of Engen, Mol&szlig;kirch and Biberach. The French must demonstrate their resourcefulness as Napoleon grows impatient and demands reinforcements from Moreau to support his offensive in Italy. Time is running out; advance in the direction of Ulm before the order arrives for the troops to depart toward the south.<br/>The three scenarios that follow relate the events in Bavaria that lead up to the clash at Hohenlinden in deplorable weather. The Archduke John, propelled by his ardour, decides to assault the French at Munich while the latter marched toward them. This battle of encounter is decisive, contrary to the battles of the spring. With this victory, Moreau succeeds in bringing to an end this war with Austria.<br/>With this new volume, the series The Marshals continues to evolve. The experience of playing numerous games as well as the requests of fans of the series led to minor adaptations integrated into the general rules as well as the addition of new optional rules.

The first player or team to create two runs wins!<br/><br/>How to Play: A player begins his turn by rolling all five dice. The combination of the dice facing up is to be read like cards in a poker hand. Viable hands include full house, straight, five of a kind, four of a kind, three of a kind, two pairs and one pair.<br/><br/>A player may throw the dice once, twice or up to three times to roll the best possible combination. After their first roll, a player can roll again anything from one to five of the dice. On your second and third rolls you can again roll one to five of the dice, including re-rolling anything you had set aside in the first roll.  After the third roll place a poker chip of your team color on the board that corresponds to the poker hand combination of dice. Then the next player to the left rolls the five dice to start their turn.<br/><br/>If the squares of the board corresponding to the dice combination rolled is already covered by a chip, then that player's turn is over and they cannot play a chip on the game board. Note: there are usually two of each possible combination on the board.<br/><br/>When a player or team places five chips in a row on the board this constitutes a run. Chips in a run are protected during the remainder of the game. A player's run may share common chips with their other runs, however, a player cannot claim a new run by adding chips to the end of an established run. A new run must contain at least 4 chips not in common with the original run.<br/><br/>The first player or team to create two runs on the board wins.<br/><br/>Special Rules:<br/>The center square on the game board that can be used by all players as part of a run, but cannot be claimed by any one player.<br/><br/>Lucky 7: Anytime a player rolls a combination of the five dice so that the face value adds up to seven a player has the option to place a chip on either Luck 7 or whatever other combination appears on the dice (full house, three of a kind, etc).<br/><br/>Lucky 11: Anytime a player rolls a combination of the five dice so that the face value adds up to eleven a player has the option to place a chip on either Luck 11 or whatever other combination appears on the dice (full house, three of a kind, etc).<br/><br/>Five of a Kind: Anytime a player rolls a five of a kind that player may place their chip on ANY open square on the game board.  Wild!<br/><br/>Bouncer: After all the &quot;straight&quot; squares on the game board are filled, every time you roll another straight the results is a &quot;bouncer&quot;. A bouncer allows the player to remove any one opponents chip from game board except a chip that has been placed in an already  completed run.<br/><br/>After all the &quot;full house&quot; squares on the game board are filled, every time you roll another straight the results is a &quot;bouncer&quot;.

The teams are represented by coloured plastic miniatures, and push-fit assembly is required before use. The game is expandable, and additional rules and teams will be made available through expansion sets and supplements.<br/><br/>Actions in the game are resolved through the use of dice. Regular six-sided dice are used to make tests in a number of cases, such as when a player attempts to pick up the ball, pass it, catch it or dodge past an enemy player.

A game of conquest, which revolves around an important and defining historical period: the 1400.<br/><br/>But this century is so much more than just a bunch of years: it&rsquo;s one of the most magnificent periods in the history of Italy and the European culture. Because it&rsquo;s not a coincidence if the end of this century marks the beginning of the &ldquo;Modern Age&rdquo;.<br/>M400 comes from the idea to bring strategic board games to the next level; neither the name nor the historical references to the XV century are just a fortuity. The century that saw the fall of the last Eastern Roman Empire, the birth of the power of Spain and England, the ascent of the Russian Republics, and the achievements of the glorious Republic of Venice are the ideal background for the birth of this new way to have fun with history.<br/>M400 has a high level of playability with multiple players, and the cards allow an always different gameplay, helping the creation of new and different matches. Every time a player finds themselves in the late Medieval period of the game, they can rewrite important pages of history in new ways, through trades, battles, journeys and revolutions. The challenge and the strategy also allow to create with the opponents new dynamics of gameplay beyond the rules: deceptions, bluffs, silent and secret alliances. The almost total absence of chances and coincidences, linked to the dices, reduces the possibility of a player to win just by chance.<br/>M400 is a game which contains very different elements, elements that can mix, and give the player a unique and unpredictable kind of entertainment. This game is for everybody, and the choice of the Latin makes it reach a new level of universality, just like the one of the world of the XV century.<br/><br/>M400 is a card-driven Risk-like game. A player's turns consists of four phases: 1) draw cards, 2) trade cards with other players, 3) move army, 4) expand. Players use cards to resolve combats and score points by occupying a region (temporary points) and defeating opponents (permanent points). The game is won by the player who first achieve a determined number of points, depending on the number of players.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Simone Bastianelli", "Alessandro Roncigli", "Diego Tognoloni"], "categories": [], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "M400", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 120, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 5.625, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.78098, "numcomments": 0}, "216554": {"mechanics": ["Paper-and-Pencil", "Voting"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3324949.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "trading": 0, "id": 216554, "yearpublished": 1988, "maxplayers": 12, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3324949_t.jpg", "publishers": ["The Literati Company"], "families": ["Dictionary Games"], "description": "Description from the back of the box:<br/><br/>Literati is a new word game that combines obscure words and quotations with your own creative and often hilarious definitions.

Its taxes are paid, and the power is on, but no one has seen anything in the house for years.

You have just been invited to play A House in New Orleans A game for 2-6 players. Some will call it a player deduction game or a game with a traitor mechanism, but most will call it horrifyingly intense. <br/>You are invited to A House in New Orleans come hungry.<br/><br/>The game takes place in an old mansion in New Orleans. Each room contains two item cards face down. Players select unique characters with special abilities and stats. They will move from room to room discovering items. Some may be traps that impede players, some may be special items that improve a character. You may only choose to carry one item, so every room will provide a new discovery and a decision.<br/><br/>Human Goal:<br/>Players are attempting to find all three items that their character requires. When one player finds all three items the game is over.  If all but one player has 2 items, the game is over as well. Each of the collected items has a point value and the points are totaled at the end of the game. You must be careful what items you choose to collect, if the items you collect are of too low a point value a player with fewer items may still win.<br/><br/>Vampire goal:<br/>Did I mention a lonely vampire has disguised themselves among the dinner guests? The goal for the original vampire is not to acquire items themselves, but to &quot;Turn&quot; human players that have already acquired items. You see, nothing tastes as good as hope. If a human is attacked and can&rsquo;t fend off the vampire, they are now secretly a vampire themselves looking for their victim. If the vampire is successfully fended off the vampire is not &ldquo;revealed&rdquo; and may become invisible (hidden player movement).  If the vampire turns a player, the new vampire gains points for the items they have already acquired but give the Vampire that turned them points as well. They do not give their &quot;Parent&quot; vampire points from the new victims they acquire. The closer a human player is to completing their goal the more valuable they are, but the more human players you &quot;Turn&quot; the more competition you make for yourself.  If you wait too long, they may be able to fend you off<br/><br/>The Clock:<br/>The old grandfather clock gongs on the hour, at which time a new event card is turned over. These events are random but become worse for the humans as the game progresses. The humans may skip an event if they place an item that turn. Do you help the other humans even though it may mean losing the game to avoid the next horrible event..it is up to you.<br/><br/>Does it sound simple?

Characters can be turned face-down in the following four ways:<br/><br/>1-When you board another players&rsquo; ship with your crew and win, for each cargo of the losing player you decline to steal you may choose a character of that player and turn it face-down.<br/><br/>2-When you bombard another players&rsquo; ship with your cannons and win, for each ship segment of the losing player you decline to damage you may choose a character of that player and turn it face-down.<br/><br/>3-&lsquo;The Artful Assassin&rsquo; can be used to turn a character of another player face-down.<br/><br/>4-&lsquo;The Sneaky Stowaway&rsquo; has to be turned face-down when it is used.<br/><br/>TURNING CHARACTERS FACE-UP<br/>Face-down characters can be turned face-up again in the following three ways:<br/><br/>1-In the Republic you may turn all your characters face-up during your harbor phase.<br/><br/>2-In the Orient you may turn all your characters face-up during your harbor phase.<br/><br/>3-At Smuggler&rsquo;s Cove you may turn all your characters face-up during your harbor phase if you have &lsquo;The Infamous Innkeeper&rsquo; and it is face-up.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Aron Groot", "Niek Jansma"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Card Game", "Nautical", "Pirates"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Captains and Characters", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.5, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.5, "numcomments": 0}, "212471": {"mechanics": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Memory", "Modular Board", "Player Elimination", "Variable Phase Order"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3241601.png", "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "trading": 0, "id": 212471, "yearpublished": 2016, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3241601_t.png", "publishers": ["(Web published)"], "families": [], "description": "In The Clockwork Conundrum, after each player receives 3 cards and 3 pawns, a modular board is formed 5 cards wide x 5 cards high (cards are left face down), surrounding a single victory card. All players besides the start player may examine their cards, and place these however desired. The start player may only see his cards after choosing which card to begin with. He places his pawn on this card.<br/><br/>Most cards have a L, M, R, or C in their upper right corner. These stand for Left, Middle, Right, and Choice. When the start player reveals his start card, it determines where the next player places his pawn. This unleashes a chain of events. The last player's pawn placement will indicate the two to four movement options for the start player. (These are indicated by direction markers on each card.) His subsequent move will indicate the next player's move and so on. This can be treacherous given the players don't know the cards they are moving to until they make their moves. It is entirely possible that a player may be forced off of the board, or onto one of the more bizarre action cards.<br/><br/>1) FREEZE: If a player settles on this card, the next player in turn order may not move. Instead whichever card he previously settled on will indicate the next player's movement options.<br/><br/>2) LAVA: If a player stumbles into a lava pit, he loses one of his three pawns and starts over on the start card indicated by the lava card.<br/><br/>3) MIRROR MIRROR: If a player settles onto a Mirror Mirror card, the next player in turn order will move across the board to the card in the mirror position.<br/><br/>4) +PAWN: If a player settles onto a +Pawn card, he adds a second pawn to the start card of his choice. This increases his movement options, since he will still only move 1 pawn at a time. Therefore, his likelihood of reaching his destination is significantly increased.<br/><br/>5) REVERSE: If a player settles onto a Reverse card, the turn order is reversed, and the player who preceded him must move in the direction indicated by the card on which he is currently settled.<br/><br/>The game only uses 37 cards. There are 41 in total. But the remaining cards are not totally useless. While increasing the variety of the modular board, the cards also help to resolve conflicts if a player has settled onto a card where his opponent is currently positioned. Each card, excluding the Victory Card, has a number 1-40. When players are involved in a conflict, each draws a card at random, and the player with the higher card gains the space, whereas the player with the lower card loses his pawn.<br/><br/>Usually any cards revealed are left face-up, but there is also a Memory Variant where after moving to a new location, any cards not currently active are flipped back to face-down.<br/><br/>Due to the unique design of the game, it may also be played cooperatively, as players work together to lead one to the Victory Card.<br/><br/>The Clockwork Conundrum is an intense puzzle game. And due to its featuring nearly 100,000 ways to set up, it is highly replayable.

There are elements of dice rolling, worker placement, engine building, resource management, tableau building, simultaneous play, and some card drafting.  Each turn is split into two phases, the day shift and the night shift.<br/><br/>During the day shift, players simultaneously roll their dice and use their dice as workers to build and activate factories.  Buildings start as blueprints and need to be constructed.  Once constructed, each building can be used once each turn.  Worker placement can happen in any order and figuring out the correct order will help you accelerate your engine.  Each day shift is like solving a unique worker placement puzzle.<br/><br/>During the night shift, players choose an action in secret.  You can choose to reinforce your current strategy or you can disrupt other players' engine.  These actions could be as innocent as drafting a new blueprint from the marketplace or it might be as destructive or sneaky as sabotage or thievery.<br/><br/>Once a player obtains 15 victory points, the game is over and the player with the most victory points wins.

Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn and finally winter.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with their own village board, a mini keyp board, 12 village tiles, a keyper (waving meeple) in their player color, and a team of eight multi-colored keyples, including two white keyples. Each differently colored keyple is a specialist in one activity: the brown keyper is a woodsman, the black keyple is a miner, the orange keyple a clay worker, etc. The white keyples are generalists who can represent any other color.<br/><br/>Keyper is a worker placement game. (Keyper is the eighth new title in the medieval Key series of games, with Keydom, the second in the series being widely recognized as the first of the worker placement genre of games.) What makes Keyper special is that when one player places a keyple on a country board, another player can join them with a matching colored keyple on the first player's turn to the benefit of both players. In this way some players are likely to have played all their keyples before others. All keyples have the potential to work twice. If a player has played all of their keyples, but another player still has some, then on their turn the player with no remaining keyples can lay down one or more keyples on the country board they have claimed or in their village board to secure additional resources or actions. It can therefore be doubly beneficial to co-operate with your fellow players, although Keyper is not a co-operative game in the usual sense of the term.<br/><br/>The country boards are also noteworthy in that they can be manipulated and folded at the beginning of summer, autumn and winter to show one of four different permutations of fields for that season. A player will chose the one to suit their strategy, often hoping that another player will complement their choice. Certain fields on the country boards are available only in certain seasons, e.g., raw materials can be upgraded to finished goods only in spring and summer after which you can only convert using tiles in your own village. Gem mining occurs only in autumn and winter.<br/><br/>A player's strategy is likely to be influenced by which (seeded) spring country tiles they acquire and by the particular colored keyples they have available in the later seasons. Different combinations will encourage a player to develop their farm or village, help with their shipping or mining activities, and prepare for the seasonal fairs. Players constantly need to evaluate whether or not to join other players, when to claim a country board, whether to play on their own or another player's country board, when to use their own village, and whether to create a large or small team of keyples for the following season. The winner is the player to gain the most points, usually through pursuing at least a couple of the different strategies.<br/><br/>In addition to the theme and mechanisms, Keyper has similar traits to the earlier Key games: Game actions are positive and constructive, not destructive; player interaction is through the game mechanisms not direct, and like Keyflower, the previous game in the series, there is a lot of player interaction.<br/><br/>A special English-language Kickstarter edition of Keyper with &quot;character&quot; keyples and keypers will also be released.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Richard Breese"], "categories": ["City Building", "Economic", "Farming", "Medieval"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Keyper", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 120, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 6.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 17}, "212523": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 0, "image": "", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 212523, "yearpublished": 1999, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "", "publishers": ["(Self-Published)"], "families": [], "description": "Octo is a press-your-luck dice-rolling game where the goal is to set, and then maintain, a high score.

To Combo, the Active Player must combine (sum the numbers on the cards) at least 2 cards and total it up to a final card.

Note that making a Combo is independent of the colors on the cards you are using. 1 can be counted as both &ldquo;1 and 11&rdquo; in value, and the special cards all have a value of 10 in the case of making Combos, and each has different abilities when you finish your Combos with them.<br/><br/>When a player performs a Combo, he puts the final card of the Combo on top of an opponent&rsquo;s face down defense card.

When a defense card has cards on it with a total of 21 or more, that defense gets destroyed, in which case the player whose defense got destroyed reveals the defense card and adds it to his/her Play-Area to use it on his/her next turn.<br/><br/>The game comes with 112 cards consisting of:<br/>        2 sets of cards that starts from 1 and goes to 10 of each color, with different weights.

If you take a trick with more than one chicken in it, you take a penalty card equal to the number of chickens you took; if you take a trick with exactly one pig in it, then you receive a reward card that gives you a bonus in the next round, such as playing your card face down or playing from any spot in your hand.<br/><br/>Once all the cards have been played, players tally their scores: each chicken claimed in -1 point, penalty cards are -3 to -15 points, and reward cards are +3 points. Whoever took the last trick can choose to ignore all chickens they took or all penalty cards they took other than those taken on the last trick. If someone uses the 0 to beat the 49 in the last trick, then they can alternatively erase the entire score from a previous game.<br/><br/>Play as many games as the number of players, then whoever has the highest score wins!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Michael Schacht"], "categories": ["Card Game"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Blindes Huhn extrem", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 20, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 1}, "212607": {"mechanics": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Variable Player Powers"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "", "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "trading": 0, "id": 212607, "yearpublished": 2013, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "", "publishers": ["WizKids"], "families": ["HeroClix"], "description": "Bring the fast-paced Western action of The Lone Ranger to your HeroClix collection!

All illustrations and design elements were produced in pen and ink and hand-painted with watercolor.<br/><br/>The goal of Zen Squire is to collect 1,000 points. Each player begins the game with five cards, drawing one card and playing one card each turn. Cards are played into the area directly in front of each player, this area is your Castle, the total sum of which is your score. Diplomat cards contain positive or negative points. Any player can play Diplomat cards to any Castle. Once your Castle totals to 1,000 points, you win the game.<br/><br/>Challenger and Defender cards contain actions, which can be played to the Discard pile in order for their action to occur. Actions may allow players to draw additional cards, steal cards from opponents, or even swap Castles! Rulers are played to any Castle and pair with a Diplomat card already in that Castle. Rulers cannot be removed by Challenger or Defender cards. Multiple Ruler cards can be paired with the same Diplomat card. Once paired with a Diplomat, Rulers may double that card's points, change a negative value to a positive value, or make that card immune to all actions.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": [], "categories": ["Card Game", "Medieval"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Zen Squire", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "216718": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3315697.jpg", "wishing": 86, "owned": 2, "trading": 0, "id": 216718, "yearpublished": 2017, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 12, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3315697_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Capstone Games", "Quined Games"], "families": ["Coal Series"], "description": "In Haspelknecht: The Ruhr Valley, an expansion for Haspelknecht, coal mining has now become an inherent and lucrative business for farmers in the Ruhr valley.

In the beautiful box is a playing board, 120 cards, and a single die.<br/><br/>The game is based on the idea that we all have positive and negative states of mind, and positive and negative emotional states. The playing board has 3 columns with mind states on the left, and 3 columns of emotional states on the right. The positive states are on the top, and the negative states are on the bottom.<br/><br/>There are 2 piles of cards - 60 mind cards with blue backs, and 60 emotion cards with maroon backs. On the top of each card is one of the 12 mind &amp; emotion states. In the middle of the card is a word that is an example of that mind or emotion state.<br/><br/>Each player takes a turn picking a card, and uses the word on that card to add to a developing story that&rsquo;s interesting and fun.<br/><br/>For example, let&rsquo;s say the first player picks the word SHY and begins the story: &quot;Ever since Barry was a little boy, he was always SHY and had trouble socializing in groups.&quot; <br/>The next player picks the word: INVESTIGATE, and continues the story: &quot;One day Barry was reading the newspaper about a neighborhood near where he lived. The article described houses that sounded like an excellent investment, and he decided to INVESTIGATE.&quot; <br/>The next player picks the word NEGLECTFUL, and says: &quot;When Barry arrived at the neighborhood, he saw that it was run down, looking as if the owners were NEGLECTFUL of the most basic repairs.&quot; <br/>While telling the story, the players move their pieces on the board trying to get each of their pieces into a top or bottom end zone. We&rsquo;ll now describe the rules of the game.<br/><br/>2 to 6 players can play. Each player gets two pieces that are placed on the start section in the middle of the board, one on the left mind side, and the other on the right emotion side of the board. Each player moves one piece up and down the mind side, and the other piece up and down the emotion side. The goal is to get each piece in either the top or bottom end zones.<br/><br/>On your turn:<br/><br/>Roll the die to see how many spaces to move either piece. <br/>Then pick a card from either the mind or emotion pile, and say out loud the category and word you picked. <br/>If you picked a mind card, move your mind piece. If you picked an emotion card, move your emotion piece. If the word you picked is positive, move your piece up. If the word you picked is negative, move your piece down. <br/>If the die is 2, 4, or 5, move your piece that many spaces. If the die is 3 or 6, move your piece 3 spaces up OR down. If the die is 1, roll again right away, and on this move you can move up OR down.<br/>So there are two goals of the game. The first goal is to tell an interesting and fun story together. The second goal is to be the first to get both of your pieces to an end zone. The end zones do not have to be reached by an exact number of moves.<br/><br/>Positive-mind cards: <br/>Analyzing, Interested, Aware <br/>Negative-mind cards: <br/>Oblivious, Uninterested, Unaware <br/>Positive-emotion cards: <br/>Up, Outward, Warm <br/>Negative-emotion cards: <br/>Down, Inward, Cold<br/><br/>You and your friends will enjoy many hours together playing the game of Mind and Emotions!!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": [], "categories": ["Party Game"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Mind & Emotions Board Game", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 120, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "216725": {"mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management"], "usersrated": 14, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3308211.jpg", "wishing": 2, "owned": 89, "trading": 2, "id": 216725, "yearpublished": 2016, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 3, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3308211_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Daily Magic Games"], "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Tableau Building"], "description": "The deluxe edition comes in a double tall box to accommodate sleeved cards, a plastic insert with separate card &amp; bits sections, foam spacers to keep cards in place, foam cover for bits control, 5 tabbed divider cards, an action selection tile, a tableau tracker, and a box sleeve.<br/><br/>In addition, it comes with the Kickstarter Bonus Content Pack, Guild Halls expansion, and Monuments expansion<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Rick Holzgrafe", "Isaias Vallejo"], "categories": ["Card Game", "City Building"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Villages of Valeria: Deluxe Kickstarter Edition", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.82143, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.02203, "numcomments": 2}, "212630": {"mechanics": ["Area Movement", "Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Player Elimination", "Variable Phase Order", "Variable Player Powers"], "usersrated": 8, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3254299.jpg", "wishing": 15, "owned": 108, "trading": 1, "id": 212630, "yearpublished": 2016, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 3, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3254299_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Asmodee", "Monolith"], "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "description": "This expension includes This pack contains 2 models, 2 character sheets (English on one side, French on the other), two Overlord tiles (non-lingual).<br/><br/><br/>    Valeria<br/><br/><br/>This version of Valeria will still be adept at close quarter combat, however, she will be a more lightly equipped incarnation, faster and more dexterous, with other uses than just combat.<br/><br/><br/>     Taramis/Salome<br/><br/><br/>Then, we have Taramis, the queen of Khauran.

Each bird is a different colour in the game.<br/><br/>Players are forest spirits, trying to secretly guide their chosen bird to success. The cards are numbered 1 to 7 in red, blue, green and white. The players lay a card from their hand to a 5x5 grid after nut tokens (points) are laid out for each row and column.<br/><br/>When the grid is full of cards, the rows and columns are checked. The colour with the highest total in a line takes the nut token for that bird. Colours with tied totals are ignored, so a low value card can win the nut token for that bird.<br/><br/>When the nuts are totalled up for the birds, the players reveal their final hand card. That card is the bird they favoured (so more than one player might be helping the same bird), and for each player, the number on the card is added to the nut total to identify who has the dominant bird.<br/><br/>Since the players choose which bird they favour by leaving it as their final hand card, they can delay this choice until they see how the game is panning out.<br/><br/>The game rules come in Japanese and English, the game itself being language free.

All of this and more will be worked out by the end of this ridiculous game.<br/><br/>Say hello to Albert Kittensworth. You can tell by the expression on his face that he is not looking forward to playing this game. But you should be. Albert may not be very good a catching mice or playing with string, but there is one skill that makes him as unique as he is precious - his ability to hold an almost limitless number of objects in his ample rear compartment. You can put anything and everything in there, and by the end of the game, you will. Well, everything but one thing, that is. There is one thing that simply will not be tolerated, so let's make this perfectly clear, DO NOT SHIT IN MY CAT.<br/><br/>Players start the game with a hand of cards that will contain some very unusual objects as well as a freshly-baked loaf that most definitely did not come from a bakery. On their turn, Albert will spin around to face them with his best side forward and they will draw a card and add it to their hand. They will then randomly select one of their face down cards, look at it and announce to the table what they are placing inside of the cat. If the card the player selected was their poo card, they should lie and claim it is a different item. After all, you wouldn't want the other players to know you just shit in the cat. It will be our little secret. Keep in mind there a few additional poo cards that you can pick up out of the draw pile and you might even start the game with more then one poo card. During each round players will draw cards, place cards and sometimes even discard each other's cards.<br/> Eventually someone will become suspicious of a fellow player and will point across the table and demand an answer to that age old question &ldquo;Did you shit in my cat?&rdquo; Once accused, the player will need to show if they still have a poo in their hand of cards. Because they cannot view their hand of cards during play, they may not know if their poo has been removed and placed inside the cat. One by one they begin to reveal their cards. If they do not have a poo card, then they indeed were the offending party member that committed this heinous act. And even though only one person was actually caught brown-handed, they were probably not the only one to leave a poo in you know who.

Your task is to combine different body parts to design the perfect freak, then lead your team of freaks to victory. The arena is controlled by the arena master, who each turn changes the conditions in the arena. To succeed, you need to complete tasks given to you by the viewers &mdash; or just destroy the other freaks and their base. But don't worry because in Space Freaks everyone wins, either by managing the winning team or by becoming a (body)part of the next winning team!<br/><br/>In more detail, during the game you build your own freaks, one body part at a time, in addition to building turrets, bunkers and droids to aid your team. Your team sponsor might also aid you in the form of items, special actions, or even alien marauders.

The German commander now seizes his chance. With superior command quality, his Panzers move twice to come out of seemingly nowhere to strike at the Soviet&rsquo;s flank. An exchange fire leaves one Soviet unit broken and other shaken. The Panzers then move out of harms way. The mobile defense prevails!<br/><br/>Most WWII rules leave you wondering how the Germans ever won a battle. Usually they fought outnumbered and against opponents with equal or superior equipment. So how did they ever win? The answer lays in their outstanding unit level leadership. Kampfgruppe Commander III places leadership quality at the forefront. Using the game&rsquo;s unique and fast-paced leader activation system, German units simply fight with more options and capabilities than their opponents. And each allied army fights differently with its unique command abilities that develop as the war progresses.<br/><br/>Kampfgruppe Commander III recreates all aspects of grand tactical mobile warfare using a scale of Company sized, multi-stand units.

This is called the field. This way, the cards create a row of cards in the field. At any time of the game, if any two of the same card is revealed on the field, the cards go to the discard pile and the turn moves to the next player clockwise order. This is called a fail. A player can stop at anytime after he/she flipped a card and resolved that card&rsquo;s action. Then the player takes the revealed cards and puts them in front of him/her. This is called collecting. The collected cards go to the collection.<br/><br/>If a player would flip a card from the deck (not look), and the deck was empty, simply shuffle the discard pile and create a new deck. When the deck fully runs out, including the discard pile, the game ends.<br/><br/>Players gain scores based on specific sets they made.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Melisa Kublay", "Tayfun Turgut"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Collectible Components", "Medieval", "Print & Play"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Build Thy Kingdom!", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 1}, "217083": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 4, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3320406.jpg", "wishing": 146, "owned": 1, "trading": 0, "id": 217083, "yearpublished": 2017, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 25, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3320406_t.jpg", "publishers": ["HUCH! & friends", "Rio Grande Games"], "families": ["GIPF Project"], "description": "LYNGK is a synthesis of the first six games of the GIPF Project.<br/><br/>The game is played with 48 pieces in six colors.
