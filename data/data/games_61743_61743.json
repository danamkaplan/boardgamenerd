Contact with an opposing piece inflicts damage, but missiles, spells, and other special abilities can cause other effects. When all of the monsters of a room have been cleared, the heroes can move further into the catacomb. Items and equipment upgrades can be purchased from the Merchant with gold taken from fallen monsters.

With 52 cards in each starter deck, choose your ship, chase down your opponents and see if you can out Captain the enemy.\n\nIn Dog Fight: Starship Edition each player controls only one ship rather than a fleet of ships or horde of characters. For 2 or more players. Three levels of game play, booster packs available. Each deck set (starter and deluxe) is designed for one player only; your opponents need their own decks.\n\nSample Turn:\n\nEach player performs 3 actions, which are either drawing a card, setting a card face down or passing. Player A has priority in this example.\n\nAction Phase 1\nFor this turn Player A sets 3 cards face down, which uses his/her 3 tiers. Player B does the same.\n\nAction Phase 2\nPlayer A's tier 1 card is flipped face up and resolves. Player B's tier 1 card is flipped face up and resolves. Tiers 2 and 3 continue in this pattern.\n\nAction Phase 3\nAll cards played that do not last are discarded to the discard pile.\nPriority player may draw 1 card from his/her deck for free.\n\nEnd of Round.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 3.6667, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Michael P.

Blue is a charades-based party game for teams of two or more players (and is best with teams of two). Before the game begins, each player looks at several cards featuring famous historical or fictional characters and chooses some of them. Each player's cards are shuffled to form a deck, and this deck is used for each of the game's three rounds.\n\nIn each round, team members take turns trying to get their teammates to guess as many names as possible in 30 seconds. In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed, and the cluegiver cannot pass on a card. In round 2, no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted); the cluegiver can pass on any card he likes, and the teammates can give only a single answer. In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as he likes; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess.

The first player to finish is not necessarily the winner. Nuts and Bolts has been designed to reward understanding the Big Six more than the roll of the die.

After months of constant retreats and loss, the Don River offered a respite. Even though the river was partially frozen, crossing proved difficult for either side except at one of the four bridges which span it. Weather and time also proved to be a friend of Denikin one last time, as both sides had to fight freezing temperatures and slowed the rapid advance of the Red Army chasing them into Rostov, a small city at the time. Much of the Red forces that reached the city were to too small and the main body of the army was still several days away.\n\nDenikin pulled his forces back to Bataisk and dug in and by the time the Red lead elements arrived, the Reds found themselves in a much weaker position because Denikin had gathered his units. Denikin planned for a quick offensive, one to retake Rostov and hopefully beyond to buy additional time before the inevitable. Retaking Rostov would also be a desperately needed morale boost. Thus, he gathered his last available Mk V tanks, aircraft, and reinforced his elite Volunteer Army. He suddenly struck, completely taking the Red units by surprise, routing many. Within a day or so, he entered Rostov, and pushed onto the suburbs along the fringe. The reversal was complete. Stunning. Morale rose. But, like the Germans and the Ardennes in 1944, the weight of the Red army was felt once it arrived. Bitter fighting in Rostov set the city on fire as the Whites fell back across the banks of the Don. It was their last hurrah!\n\nThe game comes with a 11x17\" map, 280 counters, rules.

More difficult combinations yield more victory points.\n\nFurthermore, not all of the available buildings on the table are ripe for the taking, as only the ones on the right and left hand border of the 2 rows of buildings are available for selection.\n\nThe game's core mechanic revolves around identical decks of 13 cards for each player, of which only 2 are played per round. But in addition to the card's function, the numerical combination of cards played is important (e.g. a card with a value of 3 and 4, result in the value 34) as the player with the lowest combined number acts first.\n\nSo not only is the start player constantly changing, but it is also possible that a planned action cannot be taken, as another player has already used the same role. Not all roles are exclusive, so the turn order will also determine whether your \"half of all pesos in the middle\" is half of eight, or half of four (if a player before you played the same card). Some roles allow you to tax others or steal from them, and some cards defend against this, so it's not all just collecting pieces in a solitary manner. Some combinations require the presence of an architect, so you must choose whether to use one of your two card spots for him. Other cards add different twists. What and when to choose, who to hurt, and what you're aiming for, make up the game's main decisions.\n\nThese different ideas make Havana its own game even if some of it is familiar.

Exploit categories for example might be miming a death scene, talking in your best German accent, or reading the sentence really fast.\n\nDuring any particular players' turn there are two people in an interaction. The Scribe and the Reciter; the Scribe has the challenge of choosing from a limited number of fraze and exploits that he believes the Reciter will find difficult to say in front of a group. He must consider several things, his personal knowledge of the Reciter, such as personal hang ups about saying something silly in front of a group, whether his spirit could say take the brunt awkwardness of confessing to something he didn't do, while perhaps talking like a munchkin.\n\nThe Reciter will have his/her social inhibitions challenged in simply performing in front of a group, pronouncing a made up word, or punching out a tongue twister. Since the Reciter has a very limited time to process what he/she is about to say it also provides a psycological component as it can sometimes be difficult to psyche oneself up under limited time constraints.\n\nPoints are awarded according to a simple scale, whether the Reciter was able to read the sentence out loud under duress without stopping, laughing, stammering etc, within five seconds, and whether he was able to perform the exploit to a satisfactory level.\n\nThere is a simple system where disagreements regarding the performance was acceptable or not, or whether the attempt was successful.\n\nBuy a copy of Frazed Today!\n\nIncludes:\n\n* fraze Deck (75 cards)\n    * exploit Deck (71 cards)\n    * Frazed Rules Deck (12 cards)\n    * frazed rules Document\n\n", "minplayers": 4, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Michael Ingersoll"], "categories": ["Party Game"], "minage": 12, "name": "Frazed", "playingtime": 45, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 4.5, "usersrated": 2, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 3.5, "expands": [], "numcomments": 0}, "57950": {"mechanics": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Movement", "Co-operative Play", "Modular Board", "Partnerships"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic570217.jpg", "wishing": 3, "owned": 12, "expansions": [{"id": 129012, "name": "MERC: The Expansion"}], "trading": 3, "artists": ["JT Smith"], "id": 57950, "yearpublished": 2009, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 2, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic570217_t.jpg", "publishers": ["The Game Crafter, LLC"], "families": [], "description": "From The Game Crafter's website:\n\n\"MERC is a complex strategy game where each player hires and controls a team of mercenaries.

The Trader might make a law stating The Theif loses 2 cards when they use an ability, which should put a stop to the Thief's meddling - for awhile.\n\nThings get interesting when the Doctor, Priest and Banker manipulate existing laws, and when the Thief gives up his life of crime to swap professions with another player.  The result is a game which is never the same twice, and will keep you looking for new ways to turn the situation to your advantage.\n\nLaws and Disorder is best played with 4-6 players and ample table space, although it makes for a longer and more strategic game with 2-3 players.  Package includes deck plus rules.  You must provide pocket change, play money or peanuts to use as game currency - I leave this choice up to you.\n\nWant to try before you buy?

The 1st clues are very hard (typically birth date alone), and get subsequently easier until the final 6th clue which actually tells you the name of the person!\nTo start, a player (randonly chosen) looks at the first card (in secret). The player to his left then rolls the 6-sided die. The caller then consults his card and reads out the corresponding clue as the player rolled. The roller then tries to guess the name of the famous sporting person. If guessed correctly the card is won by the roller, and then the pack and die both move clockwise for the next player to roll and the previous roller now gets to cross-reference the die score against the next card drawn.\nThere are some gifts if you roll low, as these are the harder clues.\nIf you roll 'one' you receive the first clue, but in addition you are allowed another roll to see if you manage to roll a 'two'. If so you receive the 2nd clue. If you still haven't guessed the sporting celeb you are allowed to roll again to see if you roll 'three' etc. This is called the Rule of One.\nThe Rule of Two - if a player rolls 'two' they get to hear the 2nd and 3rd clues.\nIf you roll a 'six' you effectively get given the card as the 6th clue is the person's name.\nThe remaining 10 cards in the pack are bonus cards that when drawn are revealed by the caller. They either allow him to steal subsequent cards if not guessed correctly, or ask for extra clues, or whether the subject is male or female when it is his own turn in rolling and guessing.\nWhen all the pack is used up then the game is over and the player with the most won cards is the victor. However as this can last a long time (especially if knowledge of the subject is poor), time restraint can be imposed by pre-agreeing a number of celebs for victory.\nThis is a U.K. game and therefore the sportsmen and women are predominantly famous to a U.K. audience either by virtue of being well-known domestically, and/or by having global reknown.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Dice", "Educational", "Party Game", "Sports", "Trivia"], "minage": 12, "name": "I Am: Sport Edition", "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 5.0, "usersrated": 1, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 1}, "57996": {"mechanics": ["Simulation"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic572041.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 2, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 57996, "yearpublished": 1976, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic572041_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Leicester Micromodels Ltd."], "families": [], "description": "From the preface:\n\nThese rules have been written as a companion set to the \"Napoleonic, American Civil War and Colonial Warfare Rules\" published by Leicester Micro Models.

It covers the period from about 1400 to 1790, which is covered by volume 1 of the two books.\n\nFrom BGN:\n\nIn GP, players represent families of Polish nobles who are trying to increase their wealth and influence while fending off enemy nations that constantly threaten Poland.\n\nThe four families are:\nRadziwi\u00c5\u0082\u00c5\u0082 family (white) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radziwi%C5%82%C5%82_family  \nSapieha family (red) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapieha_family \nPotocki family (blue) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potocki_family \nLeszczy\u00c5\u0084ski family (yellow) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leszczy%C5%84ski_family\n\nIn each of the four turns of GP, players place markers in five different Polish regions, and in a box representing the Polish national army.  Each marker has a number ranging from zero to five which represents the number of nobles that the player is placing in that area.  Most actions in the game require a player to remove a noble cube from an area in order to perform an action in that area.  Players also have income-generating estates in the different areas of Poland, and these holdings may determine which areas a player is most eager to defend.\n\nEach turn, players may raise private armies and use them to strike at the five nations that threaten the different areas of Poland.  If a player is successful enough at attacking an enemy nation, then that nation may not have the resources to attack Poland that turn.  Later, a roll of four die will determine which enemy nations receive reinforcements, and then enemy nations will take their turn attacking Poland.  A successful enemy invasion of Polish territory may result in players losing one or more estates in that region.\n\n\nBo\u00c5\u00bce Igrzysko - Dzieje Rzeczpospolitej Szlacheckiej.\n\n\"Nierz\u00c4\u0085dem Polska stoi\" -  nie\u00c5\u00bale kto\u00c5\u009b powiedzia\u00c5\u0082;\nLecz drugi odpowiedzia\u00c5\u0082, \u00c5\u00bce nierz\u00c4\u0085dem zginie.\nPan B\u00f3g nas ma jak b\u00c5\u0082azn\u00f3w.

Building tiles now have two sides and there are new building types for which the value is set during the game.\n\nLink to Trailer http://www.queen-games.de/index.php?id=2537----2\n\nPlay Differences from Alhambra\nAlhambra advanced. Play is the same: buy a building tile, take money or remodel. If you buy a tile for the exact amount, you can take another action, same as in Alhambra. The differences: new building types, building values are dynamic, two-sided tiles, and moats instead of walls.\n\nThere are 9 building types in Granada. Unlike Alhambra, the buildings do not have a set value. Instead, building value is determined by the count of that type of building in all players' cities times a multiplier. As in Alhambra, there are 3 scoring rounds during which each building type is examined and points awarded for the player with the majority of that type of building. In the first scoring round, A, only the player with the most tiles of a particular building type scores for that building type (1 times the total count). In the second scoring round, B, the top 2 players score (2 times the total count and 1 times the total count respectively), and in the final round, the top 3 score (3x, 2x, and 1x the total count of that building type). Scoring for a \"Beginners Game\" is a little different.\n\nThere are no ties in Granada: points are never divided like in Alhambra. In the case of two players having the same number of tiles of a particular type in their cities, the player with the highest valued tile of that type wins, and the other player takes next place. So, in Granada, it pays to buy the more expensive buildings.\n\nFor example: When the A round-scoring card is turned up, Cindy has 2 Schools, Diana has 2, Tim has 1, Tina and Bailey each have 0, for a total of 5 Schools currently in cities. Cindy's highest School is a 10, Diana's is a 7. So, in round A, Cindy would score 1 x 5 = 5 points.\n\nWhen the B round-scoring card is turned up, the count for Schools is: Cindy 2, Diana 3, Tim 1, Tina and Bailey 0 each for a total of 6 Schools. So, Diana scores 2 x 6 = 12 points and Cindy scores 1 x 6 = 6 points.\n\nIn the final round, the School count is Cindy 2, Diana 3, Tim 1, Tina 2, Bailey 0 for a total of 8 Schools in cities. Cindy's highest School is a 10, Tina's is a 4. So, Diana scores 3 x 8 = 24 points, Cindy score 2 x 8 = 16 points and Tina score 1 x 8 = 8 points.\n\nAnother difference in Granada is that the tiles are two-sided: on one side an even-numbered building of some type, on the other a different, odd-numbered building valued exactly one higher. The configuration of the buildings on both sides is identical in terms of moat placement or lack thereof on each side. When purchasing a building, a player can immediately place the building, as is, into her city or may flip it to the other side and place it in her supply for later placement during a remodel action.\n\nThe Building Market is initially filled with tiles even-side up. The next time the market is filled, the odd side will be placed up, then even, then odd, etc. A handy toggle feature is provided on the board near the Building Market to facilitate this.\n\nThe last difference between Alhambra and Granada, moats instead of walls, is really just a difference in artwork. As in Alhambra, during each scoring round, each player scores points for her longest continuous moat, instead of wall, surrounding her city. The rules are the same regarding tile placement: must be able to trace an unbroken path back to the city's center, moat can touch moat, etc. In games I've played, players have often commented that it seems to be harder to build with the moat tiles of Granada than with the wall tiles of Alhambra.

This deluxe glow-in-the-dark edition features classic Scrabble crossword game play and a board shaped like Jac's face. Some extra creepy rules and terrifying bonus dictionary words will send you into the night for the absolutely most frightening fun game of Scrabble you've ever played.\n\nThis game is Scrabble with a differently shaped board that is not the standard 15x15 board and a theme from Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. The game also features 5 extra tiles with character from the movie which, if drawn can be played to allow special actions. \nThe characters and actions are:\nChristmas Gift from Halloween Town: Give your opponent an unwanted gift of any tile you want to get rid of. Blind draw one of his/hers.\nZero the Ghost Dog: After an opponent places a word, use this tile to change one of their letter points to zero points. This zero will now affect any double/triple letter or point spaces. The score should be adjusted.\nOogie Boogie: Oogie Boogie loves to gamble and is ready to test his luck by mixing up everyone's tiles. After a player plays this special tile all players place their tiles face down and mixes thime up. Players now pick new tiles without looking at them. The original player who first restented the Oogie Boogie tile chooses whehter or not to participate in the reshuffle.\nSally: When Sally needs to escape for the night she often slips deadly nightshade into Dr. Finklestein's soup causing him to sleep long enough for her to sneak away. Use this tile to make your next opponent \"sleep\", causing them to have their turn skipped. Play continues with the next player.\nMayor: The Mayor of Halloweentown often flips his head around to express joy or anxiety and this tile can help you \"flip\" your opponent's rack around. When using this tile, choose any opponent to spin his/her rack around. He/she can spin the rack as fast as he/she likes but should be careful as tiles often fly off in many directions.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Word Game"], "minage": 8, "name": "Scrabble: Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas Edition", "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 5.66667, "usersrated": 6, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 2.21108, "expands": [], "numcomments": 2}, "58157": {"mechanics": ["Hand Management"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2537615.jpg", "wishing": 28, "owned": 1107, "expansions": [], "trading": 33, "artists": ["Alex Aparin", "Alex Boyd", "Jaime Carrillo", "Carl Frank", "David Gallagher", "Ilich Henriquez", "Ralph Horsley", "Michal Ivan", "Michael Phillippi", "Eric Polak", "Wayne Reynolds", "Franz Vohwinkel", "Sam Wood", "Sandara Tang Sin Yun"], "id": 58157, "yearpublished": 2009, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 15, "wanting": 13, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2537615_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Edge Entertainment", "Fantasy Flight Games", "Galakta", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Nexus", "Stratelibri", "Wargames Club Publishing"], "families": ["Living Card Game", "Warhammer Fantasy Card Games", "Warhammer: Invasion \u2013 Living Card Game"], "description": "The first battle pack, The Skavenblight Threat, saw the emergence of the diseased and squabbling Skaven.

Rat Ogres can allow you to get more out of your Skaven units, and the terrifying Clan Moulder Elite Rat Ogres are solid walls of muscle that can overwhelm many a foe.\n\nEmpires rise and fall, and they require development and support if they are to last. The Scout Camp can provide you new options, and the Anvil of Doom assists the forces of Order by improving the quality of their weapons and armour. Each side will be forced to employ new tactics in an ever-shifting tide of battle and kingdom-building. Mob Up lets the Orcs see the fruits of their fighting, without that annoying Order ability to cancel damage getting in the way.

The board has numbered spaces for 10 noun cards, a space for the adjective card, and a scoring track. The noun cards are drawn and placed face-up, one in each of the numbered spaces on the board. An adjective card is turned over. Players select the one noun they think most closely fits the adjective, place their vote face down on the table, and then take turns revealing their selection. The answer receiving the greatest number of votes is deemed the winning answer and the players who chose the winning answer move ahead one space.

Given, for example, the following randomly selected noun cards:\n\n* Bee Hive\n    * Bed Bug\n    * My Daddy\n    * Nemo\n    * World Peace\n\nWhich would you vote for if the adjective were (also a random sample):\n\n* Rare\n    * Adorable\n    * Unforgettable\n\nIf the adjective were \"rare,\" which do you think is, um, rarest: your daddy, world peace, Nemo? Which the most adorable? Which the most self-evidently unforgettable?\n\nEven as the mature person you most obviously are, you'd still have a somewhat clear and more or less patently obvious choice, regardless of which adjective was chosen. And, with an \"opponent\" of the unabashed certainty of an eight-year-old, you know there will be strong opinions about everything. This is what makes the Junior Edition so appealing: everyone counts, everyone in the family finds themselves personally invited, everyone has an opinion, everyone feels equally entitled, equally correct, and, with the Junior edition, pretty much equally informed. How many family games can you say that about?\n\n", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 2.5, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["Children's Game", "Word Game"], "minage": 8, "name": "Consensus Junior", "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}, {"friendlyname": "Children's Game Rank", "name": "childrensgames", "value": null}], "average": 7.10714, "usersrated": 14, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 1.69472, "expands": [], "numcomments": 9}, "58239": {"mechanics": ["Betting/Wagering", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2951669.png", "wishing": 0, "owned": 5, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 58239, "yearpublished": 1987, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 1, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2951669_t.png", "publishers": ["Murfett Regency"], "families": ["Country: Australia"], "description": "Strike it Rich on the Gold Fields of Australia and then chance your arm in any number of wagers on the Golden Mile.\n\nThis game is all about finding Golden Nuggets to strike it rich and then taking on your fellow miners in any number of gambling games in the hope that their wealth will soon be your wealth!\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Peter Harris", "Guy Hayes"], "categories": ["Children's Game"], "minage": 8, "name": "Golden Mile", "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}, {"friendlyname": "Children's Game Rank", "name": "childrensgames", "value": null}], "average": 6.0, "usersrated": 1, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 3}, "58246": {"mechanics": [], "median": 0.0, "image": null, "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 58246, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": null, "publishers": ["(Unpublished)"], "families": ["Admin: Unreleased Games"], "description": "[b]Make One[/b] is a two player game played with fraction dice.

All of the forum posts, and linked items are being moved to the individual game entries, with anything sufficiently generic being linked to the Summoner Wars Master Set. All content will be maintained.\n\nSummoner Wars is a fast-playing, action-packed 2-4 player card game.  Players take on the role of Summoners: powerful beings who harness the power of mysterious Summoning Stones to lead their race to conquest on the war-torn planet of Itharia.  These Summoners wield terrible magic on the battlefield, freezing their foes in place, draining their enemies of power, and even bringing rains of fire down from the heavens.   But most notoriously, they summon their great race\u2019s hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy.  A Summoner is both mage and general, and must combine their wizardly might with clever tactics to defeat the enemy Summoner on the opposite side of the battle.\n\nEach Starter Set of Summoner Wars contains 2 complete, battle-ready Factions, ready to jump you and an opponent into the thick of the War for Itharia.  Each Faction is a unique race or civilization with its own secret goals, be it wild-eyed Elves bent on revenge, or blood-crazed Goblins who merely want to set the world ablaze.  Starter Sets also include everything you will need to play, including a Battle Mat, Wound counters, dice, and a rulebook.\n\nBut the war doesn\u2019t end there!  Summoner Wars is fully expandable with entirely new faction decks such as the hideous Undead of the Fallen Kingdom, or the righteous and knightly Human Vanguards.  In addition, each Faction will have its own expansions, adding new warriors, summoners, and abilities to allow for a never-ending mix of combat options and surprises.  Expansions will also include Mercenary units - warriors who care nothing for politics and will fight for any side that can afford them!\n\nSummoner Wars uses a simple but deep rules set to capture both the strategy of deck construction and card playing, with the tactics of miniature war games.  By purchasing expansions or multiple Starter Sets, players can customize their Faction Decks to suit any style of play and to keep their opponents guessing.  During the game, players summon and move their various warriors about the battlefield using their unique powers and abilities to wreak havoc on the enemy lines.  In the course of a game each side will inflict terrible casualties upon the other in their brutal quest for victory.\n\nNote: This entry in the BGG database is used to consolidate questions and discussion regarding the Summoner Wars series; it does not correspond to a particular box or deck of the Summoner Wars game.

Seen from the eyes of those who fight and die in this epic struggle, this book includes articles and intelligence excerpts from across the Inner Sphere, along with additional rules and campaign tracks for both Classic BattleTech and Classic BattleTech RPG games, from the unwilling allies of the Blakist war machine, to the experimental technologies that gave the Word its incredible - if costly - edge for years, to several new BattleMechs, vehicles, and combat spacecraft that debuted in the midst of this turning point in the war.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 4.0, "expansion": true, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Fighting", "Miniatures", "Wargame"], "minage": 14, "name": "Classic Battletech: Jihad Hot Spots 3076", "playingtime": 120, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}, {"friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "name": "wargames", "value": null}], "average": 7.0, "usersrated": 4, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.707107, "expands": [{"id": 31759, "name": "Battletech Introductory Box Set"}], "numcomments": 0}, "58312": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic956699.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 4, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": ["Antonella Bolliger-Savelli"], "id": 58312, "yearpublished": 1983, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic956699_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Herder Spiele"], "families": ["Animals: Cats"], "description": "Cooperative game for children.

In this way, each placement not only blocks the opponents from choosing the same square (except monuments, where multiple players are always allowed), but also forces the player to place his remaining pawns only on the squares below the one he just occupied (note that \"pawns\" are placed, since \"workers\" are one of the resources of the game, like grain and stones).\n\nWhen the placement phase is over, the workers of the players must be fed with the grain produced in the fields. The production of each field is based on the floods of the Nile, so some fields may not give grain each turn. If a player has not enough grain for all his workers, he has to buy it with Victory Points (the ratio is better for players with improved mercantile capabilities, recorded on a specific track on the board).\n\nAfter that, stones are received from the owned quarries and used to build the monuments (if the right to do was reserved earlier) along with the workers.\n\nWhen the game ends, the points scored during the game (mainly building the monuments) are added to the bonuses obtained fulfilling certain conditions on the Sphinx cards. Whoever has the highest total is the winner.\n\nOnline Play\n\n\n     Yucata (turn-based)\n\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.8305, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 7.12837, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Acchittocca", "Flaminia Brasini", "Virginio Gigli", "Stefano Luperto", "Antonio Tinto"], "categories": ["Ancient", "Farming"], "minage": 12, "name": "Egizia", "playingtime": 90, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": 228}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": 135}], "average": 7.45979, "usersrated": 4268, "alternative_names": ["Dolina Kr\u00f3l\u00f3w", "\u00dadol\u00ed kr\u00e1l\u016f"], "stddev": 1.18022, "expands": [], "numcomments": 908}, "58423": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Point to Point Movement", "Simulation"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic611405.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 60, "expansions": [], "trading": 1, "artists": ["Peter Dennis"], "id": 58423, "yearpublished": 2009, "maxplayers": 10, "numweights": 1, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic611405_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Osprey Publishing"], "families": ["Field of Glory"], "description": "From the web\n\"If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete\" (Sun Tzu, The Art of War).

When war resumes in August, the focal point of maneuvers centers on this French central position.\n\nDresden 20 presents a Deluxe Edition treatment the Napoleonic 20 Series, and launches a new sub-series of \"Germany 20\" 1813 games (all of which will ultimately link into a campaign of connected battles with the results from one affecting the next in the series). Dresden 20 includes a bit more of everything than other games in this series (map size, counters and exclusive rules), thus allowing players to gain a deeper insight into the campaign around Dresden during those fateful days. Important decisions weighing up all of the principles of war must be made to win this campaign!\n\nCan you maintain French dominance with a coalition-ending smashing victory?

In the beginning, the insect realms have different amounts of resources; some are poor while some have plenty. The poorest player, being the most desperate and thus also bravest, starts. The game is a mix of co-operative and individual play, as typically the players can only advance on the board by sharing their income. Likewise, the draconian measures of the Tyrant usually affect all the players and not just the intended victim. The idea is to expose the Tyrant and fill everyone's resources, and the winner is the player who accomplishes the second goal after the first one has already been accomplished.\n\nThe three types of resource are: Food & Water, Money & Wealth, Education & Rights.\n\nThe insect realms are:\n\n1.

You start as the ruler of a single kingdom, but over the course of the game kingdoms can change hands, and you may find yourself wearing several crowns - or no crown at all. Your ultimate goal is to gain Glory by enriching the kingdoms you have had the opportunity to rule; when you develop a kingdom\u2019s institutions or increase the size of its domain by conquering new lands, you gain Glory. Accumulate enough Glory and you get to claim an Achievement, which grants all your kingdoms a special bonus or capability. When all Achievements have been claimed, the game ends and the player with the most Glory wins.\n\nBlood of Kings is a unique blend of warfare, civilization building, and political maneuvering. Each turn you choose the course of action for each of your kingdoms. Will you attempt to expand militarily, or focus on developing institutions to make your kingdoms stronger, more productive, and more culturally advanced? At some point you will have to divert attention and resources away from these projects to root out enemies at court, for your rule is never truly secure - other players are your constant rivals, quietly positioning themselves to claim rights to your throne or thrust your kingdoms into violent rebellion. If you aren\u2019t careful, you can find your crown stripped away and given to another, forcing you into exile to brood and plot your eventual return to power.\n\nBlood of Kings is card-driven, but not in the traditional manner. Each kingdom has its own hand of Kingdom cards, each of which denotes a type of action (development, raising troops, taxation, etc.), and each turn its ruler chooses one card to play from those still in hand. It is through these actions that players gain Glory and win the game. However, each player also has a hand of Dynasty cards, which he can use each turn to hinder other kingdoms, improve his political hold on his own kingdoms, or prepare to take political control of rival kingdoms. Therefore, each player must work not only to expand and improve his kingdoms, but to defend his kingdoms against political rivals while positioning himself to take over as many kingdoms as possible.\n\nThe game is of the free D.I.Y. variety - you will have to print your own components. Playing time is scalable. Since the game ends when all available Achievements have been claimed, you can set up a short game by using only a few Achievements, or create a truly epic game by making all of the Achievements available.\n\n", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 4.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Deron Dorna"], "categories": ["Civilization", "Medieval", "Political", "Print & Play"], "minage": 12, "name": "Blood of Kings", "playingtime": 180, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 7.0, "usersrated": 1, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 2}, "58706": {"mechanics": ["Set Collection"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic576315.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": ["(Uncredited)"], "id": 58706, "yearpublished": 2009, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic576315_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Alex Toys"], "families": ["Food / Cooking"], "description": "A children's game.

But everyone knows that chance plays quite important role in real combats. Up till now every fusillade destroyed one battle unit (one prism), an attacking bomber squadron destroyed one battle unit of the attacked ship (one prism) and so on. Now combat rules has changed by Point Luck Card.\n\nRules:\n\nA) How many dices are rolled?\n\nAttacker rolls as many dices as many Battle units he use for attack. For example a fully equipped (3 prisms) battleship can use up to 3 dices. But if it have moved in the turn, you need to reduce number of dices according to number of moves.\n\nIf more bomber squadron attack a ship, you can use as many dices as you have squadrons (cylinders).\n\nYou never roll more than three dices. The fourth, fifth etc. attack is always succesfull.\n\nYou can, of course, use only one dice and roll it more times up to number set above.\n\nYou can stop your attack at any moment and use your actions to move out.\n\nB)Where put deffender his Battle units\n\nB1) Rows\nAccording to number of Battle units uses deffender the first, second or third row of Point Luck Card.\n\nThe first row has a symbol of one Battle unit, second row has a symbol (prism) of two and third row of three (or more) battle units. So if you have (as a deffendor) one attacked Battle unit, you use first row and so on.\n\nB2)Columns\nB2a) First row\n\nTo which column has a deffender to put his BU? It\u00b4s only his decision.\n\nExpamle: In case of one BU form columns 1-4 and 3-6 two groups. If deffendor puts his BU to number 2, his BU will be destroyed if attacker will roll 1,2,3 or 4. From previous text implies that more BU attacker has, more attamptions has to roll.\n\nB2b) Second row\nIn the second row are fields splitted to half, so columns 1-3 and 4-6 forms units. Because deffendor has two BU, he can choose whether to split them or put both BU to one section. In first case he will for sure loose at least one BU. (And of course attacker can roll the dice according to number of his attacking BU.)\n\nB2c) Third row\nWhen has a deffendor three or more BU, he can place them in the third row. Here fields 1-2, 3-4 and 5-6 forms units.\nWhen is the Point Luck Card used?\n\nC) Point Luck Card is used all the time when:\n\n\n     battleship fires\n     bombers attack\n     fighters attack bombers (even in case when it is turn of player whose bombers try to flight through place where enemy\u00b4s fighters are.\n     whne fighter shoots on un-armed fighter \n\n\nD) And when NOT to use the Point Luck Card?\n\nPoint Luck Card is not used in case of:\n\n\n     battalions combat\n     armed fighters combat \n\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": true, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Jan Divecky"], "categories": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Nautical", "World War II"], "minage": 8, "name": "Pacific 1942 Point Luck", "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 0.0, "usersrated": 0, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [{"id": 31229, "name": "Pacific 1942 Admiral"}], "numcomments": 0}, "58745": {"mechanics": [], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic582613.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 6, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 58745, "yearpublished": 2001, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic582613_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Web published)"], "families": ["Aliens", "Looney Pyramids", "Mars"], "description": "Invaders of Mars is a board game for two or more players using Icehouse pieces set in the genre of the B-rated sci-fi thriller movie.

Income generated by these enables them to raise armies and to bribe nobles, bishops and ship captains to change allegiance. Players then use secret planning and simultaneous deployment to gain control of the six areas in England and Wales and, hopefully, enough votes in parliament to crown their royal heir as king.\n\nFrom the back of the box:\n\n        Journey back to England, 1450, just prior to the outbreak of the bitter civil war between the Royal Houses of Lancaster and York. Henry VI, a Lancastrian, was proving to be a weak ruler, so the wealthy and ambitious Richard, Duke of York, looked to put things right. The powerful noble families had to choose sides and over the next 40 years, kings, royal heirs, and great nobles were to die, in what was to become known as the Wars of the Roses. Players take on the role of Lancastrians and Yorkists, who must gather support from the major towns and powerful noble families and attempt to control the royal castles throughout the country. Ports, the shipping trade, and financial aid from the Church and France are also needed. As their faction grows in strength, players vie for the King\u2019s favor and look to earn the prestigious titles of Captain of Calais, Archbishop of Canterbury, Warden of the Cinque Ports, Lord High Admiral and Constable of the Tower of London. Money means power, because loyalty can be bought, so players should be prepared for the inevitable treachery as nobles change allegiance at crucial times, affecting the balance of power. When Parliament is called, each region in England will support one or other of the two Royal Houses and the crown will go to the one with the greater power base. Nobles loyal to this House will be rewarded by a grateful King. Eventually, only one Royal House will boast the King, but the player who has gathered the most money and prestige will win, regardless of his allegiance.\n\n\n\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 3.1879, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 6.61419, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Peter Hawes"], "categories": ["Civil War", "Medieval", "Political", "Wargame"], "minage": 13, "name": "Wars of the Roses: Lancaster vs. York", "playingtime": 180, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": 667}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": 351}], "average": 7.35681, "usersrated": 1315, "alternative_names": ["Rozenoorlog", "Wars of the Roses"], "stddev": 1.44544, "expands": [], "numcomments": 435}, "58961": {"mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Variable Player Powers"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1077806.jpg", "wishing": 22, "owned": 386, "expansions": [], "trading": 13, "artists": [], "id": 58961, "yearpublished": 2009, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 3, "wanting": 9, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1077806_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Edge Entertainment", "Fantasy Flight Games"], "families": ["Animals: Wolves", "A Game of Thrones LCG", "Living Card Game", "A Song of Ice and Fire"], "description": "The \"Defenders of the North\" series of Chapter Packs features characters, locations, and events surrounding the epic struggles at The Wall and beyond.

When this occurs, other tiles \"march\" in to fill the gap, potentially moving tiles closer or farther away from their targets.\n\nThe victor is the last player with a general in play.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Brian Vogle"], "categories": ["Fantasy", "Print & Play"], "minage": 10, "name": "March of War", "playingtime": 90, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 7.0, "usersrated": 1, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 2}, "59092": {"mechanics": ["Point to Point Movement"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic596701.jpg", "wishing": 2, "owned": 5, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 59092, "yearpublished": 2004, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic596701_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Old Time Games"], "families": [], "description": "Two Games in One!\n\nNINE MAN MORRIS\nand\nTHE KING & THE KNIGHTS\n\nGames of Skill & Strategy\n\nMfg. by\nOLD TIME GAMES, INC.\n\nAlso manufacturing\nKUBB - The Viking Game(tm)\n\n-- from the tube\n\nTHE KING & THE KNIGHTS\n\nThis old Viking game, discovered in a Danish reenactment village, is played as a competition between two players.

Although it seems to only have been published in 2009, the copyright on the rules is 1985, and the approach of the tennis game (a good serve is always followed by the server going to the net for a volley, for example) dates from that era.\n\nThe 'basic' game is a D6 dice game, with no skill involved. The throw for the serve decides whether it is an ace, a fault, or in play resulting in either a groundstroke rally or the server at the net. Subsequent shots in the rally can be winners or faults, change the positions of the players (at the net or baseline) or keep them as is. There are slightly differing shot results for each die roll, depending on the positioning of the players, and what sort of shot is played (passing shot or lob when the opponent is at the net, smash or volley when you are at the net).\n\nThe 'advanced' game follows the same format as the dice game, but allows players to have cards that can be used instead of a throw of the dice. The number of these cards is limited, so there is some player judgement as to when best to play them, or roll the die. 3 Cards are given when serving (presumably so the server usually has more cards than the receiver, and thus an advantage) and 1 card for the winner of each game. The cards either are the equivalent of throwing a \"6\" (e.g. Service ace, passing shot winner, or the \"hit glorious and impossible winning shot\" (which can be beaten by another one!) ) or introduce another event such as a let or foot fault on the opponent's serve.\n\nComponents:\n2 D6\n2 die shakers\npack of 52 cards \ndrawstring bag\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Ian S.

It is basically a 100-games-in-1 cardgame system.\n\nThe Rainbow Deck (RD) is a cardgame system that has a total of 162 cards. There are 12 suits with each suit having 13 ranks, and 6 Joker cards. The suits are represented by both colour and number. The ranks are from 0 to 9, J to K. The cards also numbered from 0 to 119, and have letters from A to Z.\n\nThe RD can be adapted to play a variety of modern designer games, like what a deck of playing cards does for traditional cardgames. The difference is that the RD has 8 more suits, numbers from 0 to 119 as well as alphabet letters, thus it is most suitable for playing abstract games that require numbers, colours or letters. It can also be used by game designers as components in their own prototype games. Players can also combine the RD with other boardgames with components having colours, numbers or letters to form new games!\n\nThe RD can be complemented by 6 colours x 27 chips, 6 coloured dice and 6 coloured pawns/meeples. This allows playing of cardgames that require chips, dice or pawns. The chips can be marked using permanent markers with the corresponding values on one side. Also, the cardbacks have a 2x2 checkerboard pattern and they can be used to form boards which, together with the chips and pawns, can be used to play a variety of abstract games.\n\nDecks that the RD can be mapped into\n\n     Sequence of numbers of 0 to 119\n     Letters with values similar to Letter Head\n     12 suits (colour/number) x 1-13 values\n     6 suits (icon) x 1-23 values (2x10+3)\n     6 suits (icon) x 2 copies of 1-13 values\n     12 suits (colour/number) x 2 copies of 1-6 dice values\n     6 suits (icon) x 4 copies of 1-6 dice values \n     6 suits (icon) x 26 letter cards\n     n * 26 letter cards + rare letter cards\n     1 copy x value 1,..., 12 copies x value 12(Q), 13 copies x value 13(K+joker)\n     Double-Nine domino set x 2 copies\n\n\n\n\n\nRainbow Deck - One Deck for Infinite Games!\n\n\n\"Interesting idea.

Auction Token, used to show active player to maintain play order.\n\nPlay: The game is played over 3 epochs (rounds).  Each round ends when the Sun of Ra (time) track is filled.  \nAny non Sun tile is placed on the Auction track, in the case of double sided tiles the active player decides which side to use.  Auctions can either be called by a player (instead of drawing a tile), or automatic when the auction track is filled.  Each player may make one open bid, or pass.  The winner takes the tiles in the auction track and swaps his bidding tile with the one in the middle.  If all players pass (for example to avoid Plague tiles) then these tiles are taken out of play.\n\nScoring: At the each epoch VPs, or Ankhs, are awarded for most of a type or a variety of People & Buildings.  Penalties are awarded for Plagues (which can be offset by a number of Priests).  People and Priest tiles are then taken out of play, Buildings, Pyramids & Plagues are carried over into the next epoch, so can be scored again.  At the end of the 3rd epoch, Pyramids are also scored by construction height and tiles used.  Ankh collections are now converted to points.  Finally a bonus & penalty is also awarded depending on a players bidding tiles.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.2556, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 6.24006, "implementations": ["Ra"], "designers": ["Reiner Knizia"], "categories": ["Ancient", "Mythology"], "minage": 12, "name": "Priests of Ra", "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": 1286}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": 639}], "average": 6.90821, "usersrated": 981, "alternative_names": ["Kap\u0142ani Ra", "Die Priester des Ra", "\u592a\u9633\u795e\u7684\u796d\u53f8 (\u592a\u967d\u795e\u7684\u796d\u53f8)"], "stddev": 1.26816, "expands": [], "numcomments": 324}, "59755": {"mechanics": ["Roll / Spin and Move", "Variable Player Powers"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic585714.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 59755, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 2, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic585714_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Unknown)"], "families": [], "description": "Three Burglars are trying to steal two jewels, while being chased by the police.

One player can choose the same character as another player's ; in this case you replace the character with one of the extra tokens.\n- Strong: he replaces the trials with his strength\n- Clever: he uses his brain\n- Lucky: for him every trial is equally difficult; he trusts his luck\n- Good hearted: uses his good heart\nThere are several characters who accompany you. They are represented with cards and if you defeat them you can take their cards. If you have these characters first they will try to complete the trials for you. If they do not succeed then it is your turn. At the same time you can have two helpers.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Children's Game", "Dice"], "minage": 6, "name": "Mendeg\u00e9l\u0151", "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}, {"friendlyname": "Children's Game Rank", "name": "childrensgames", "value": null}], "average": 0.0, "usersrated": 0, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 0}, "59815": {"mechanics": ["Simulation"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic587757.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 59815, "yearpublished": 1970, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic587757_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Samsonite Corporation"], "families": ["Sports: Golf"], "description": "Golf version of a series of board games published by the luggage company Samsonite.

In 1880, the discovery of oil in the archipelago made them once again a potential source of enormous wealth.\n\nBut as oil became the underpinning of 20th century economies, the Netherlands this time failed to build the naval strength necessary to guard the islands from predatory enemies. Conservative economists clung to the gold standard in the 1930s, dooming the Dutch economy to a prolonged Depression. By the time the Navy began to see increased funding, it was much too late to change the outcome of the Japanese invasion of the Dutch East Indies.\n\nIn the 1930s, Dutch shipyards stood at the leading edge of naval technology: Dutch submarines first deployed the schnorkel breathing device, for example, and Dutch warships boasted the sophisticated Hazemeyer fire control system that would be enthusiastically copied by the Royal Navy and others. The Netherlands had the means to create a large and modern fleet, and the oil wealth of Borneo and Sumatra provided the motive. But by seeing deficits as a more lethal enemy than the Axis, the government doomed both the home country and the colonies to defeat and occupation.\n\nSpice Islands is a Second World War at Sea supplement exploring the alternate history possibilities had the Netherlands built the necessary naval and air forces to defend the East Indies and its oil: ships and planes within its financial and industrial capability.  The supplement includes ten scenarios, or separate game situations, based on battles that might have been waged by the Royal Netherlands Navy against the Japanese. The pieces represent modernized versions of the dreadnought battleships planned but not completed, and some of those planned or discussed but never built. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Strike South to play most of the scenarios and Midway to enjoy all of them.\"\n\nSpice Islands was originally sold exclusively via pdf download.

The geographic features (resource hexes) and cities mirror the approximate location of their real-world counterparts. \"Harbors\" ring the playing field.\n\nThe rules of Bavaria cleave closely to those of standard Catan, with a few departures to keep things interesting. Players may only build cities in the round intersections denoting actual cities. Because some of the cities are only one hexside apart, the spacing rule requiring two roads between settlements is not in effect. Having built a road to a hex with a settlement, one cannot build a road leaving it until one has build a settlement on the hex. Finally, to obtain the benefit of a harbor, it is only necessary to lay a road on the hexside shaded in red.\n\nPart of the Catan series.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "expansion": true, "bayesaverage": 5.55654, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Klaus Teuber"], "categories": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Negotiation"], "minage": 10, "name": "Catan Geographies: Bayern Edition", "playingtime": 45, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 6.92286, "usersrated": 35, "alternative_names": ["Catan Geographies: Bavaria", "Die Siedler von Catan: Bayern Edition"], "stddev": 1.03843, "expands": [{"id": 13, "name": "Catan"}], "numcomments": 24}, "60136": {"mechanics": ["Simulation", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic589774.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 3, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 60136, "yearpublished": 2006, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic589774_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Gammazon Publishing"], "families": [], "description": "All American is the second The Face of Battle WW2 expansion pack.

The game may also be won by the Free People by completing the quest of the Ringbearer and trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Hidden movement prevents Sauron's awareness of the real intention of his enemies and keeps him looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring. The Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.\n\nLimited and different choices are offered each turn through the roll of action dice which dictate the type of actions may be performed.  The choices range from personal character actions to political and military decisions through which to develop your winning strategies.\n\nThe War of the Ring Collector's Edition brings all that was in the base game and introduces factions, new characters and new events from the expansion, including Galadriel, the Balrog, the Ents, Dunlendings, Siege Towers, Catapults, Corsairs, and more. It is a complete game with updates to the original game rules and incorporates the expansion rules and cards to allow for new strategies to play out.  This increases both the offensive options of the Shadow Forces and defensive options of the Free Peoples.  This all-in-one version of the game is deeper, more comprehensive, and offers both more, and more difficult, choices of what path to pursue to victory, and where to spend one\u2019s resources.

It is a simple roll and move game played with two dice, with spaces that cause you to move back, lose a turn, etc. If one reads the rules which are printed on the game board, there is also an element of gambling as well as elements of an early party or drinking game. The game starts by the players agreeing on \"what to play for,\" \"which is to be lay'd down and then you must throw who shall play first.\" Some spaces require the player to put up an additional wager: \"He that throws upon 38 must feast with Cupid paying his share, that is, as much as he stak'd down first, and must remain there till his Companions have play'd once about.\" If you land on space 30 you have to wash yourself in the fountain \"until dispac'd by some other.\" If you land on 59, the bottle space, the player is \"to drink a Glass and pay a stake till his turn comes to throw again.\" It was first published by R.H. Laurie in England about 1747, and was later published by Bowles & Carver of London, who also published the \"Royal and Entertaining Game of the Goose.\" Many of the prints available today appear to be reproductions of the Bowles & Carver edition. It may be descended from Mehen. This game, as well as Mehen and the Game of Goose may also be related to the Phaistos Disk, which dates to about 1600 BCE and which some have theorized may be an ancient board game.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["Dice", "Party Game", "Racing"], "minage": 10, "name": "The Royal Pastime of Cupid or Entertaining Game of the Snake", "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 0.0, "usersrated": 0, "alternative_names": ["The Royall Pass-Tyme of Cupid or the New & Most Pleasant Game of The Snake"], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 0}, "60176": {"mechanics": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic591370.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 5, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 60176, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic591370_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Cardinal"], "families": [], "description": "A simple roll and move game for 2 players.

If someone guesses correctly, both you and the guesser move forward on the game pad \u2013 but beware of laugh attacks, since a player who laughs at the actor has to move one step back!\n\n", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": [], "minage": 6, "name": "I am, I do Travel", "playingtime": 20, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 6.0, "usersrated": 2, "alternative_names": ["Koko Perhe n\u00e4yttelee matkapeli"], "stddev": 1.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 2}, "52079": {"mechanics": ["Partnerships"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic529663.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 52079, "yearpublished": 2008, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic529663_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Tactic"], "families": ["Smart 7"], "description": "Smart7 is a set of entertaining and handy sized trivia games for the whole family.

It's suggested for two to four players, but any number can play.\n\n\n\n     High Roller -- A simple dice game suggested for two to four players, but any number can play. In turn, players roll two regular six-sided dice, then re-roll the lower, keeping track of their score. This is for the youngest players who are just learning how to count pips. The highest score after two rounds wins.\n\n\n\n     Matching Coin Game -- A game about matching coins rolled on a special die showing pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters, and placing them into the correct segments of a money tray. It's suggested for four or five players, but any number could play.\n\n\n\n     Monster Squeeze Game -- A two player guessing / deduction game using a special board and monster figures to keep track of high and low guesses on a number line.

Weakened by a decade of humiliation from foreign powers following the Opium War, the Qing Imperial Government is at odds with itself about how to rule the country.  One side argues that China should adopt Western practices and institutions in order to level the playing field abroad.  The opposition claims that China must continue to stand defiant of foreign influence and forge its own path.  At the same time, a failed Confucian scholar in a desolate region of the South has recently proclaimed himself a high place in a foreign religion--the younger brother of Jesus Christ.\n\nSo moved by his visions, he begins gathering followers to act against the government whose Confucian ideals had ranked him so poorly.  The pool he draws from consists not only of those who had been downtrodden and forgotten by the massive and corrupt governmental bureaucracy, but also wealthy families who believe a Han Chinese national could lead their people much better than the foreign Manchu from the North, who had conquered China almost two centuries before.\n\nThis prophet's name? Hong Xiuquan\n\nHis mission?  To expunge the Manchu demon rulers from the Han kingdom and usher in a new era of peace and prosperity on Earth.\n\nThe eventual death toll?  Over 20 million.\n\nWelcome to the Heavenly Kingdom of Greater Peace--Taiping.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGame Information\n\nThe Scramble for China is a two player war-game set in the most destructive period of the 19th century, the Taiping Rebellion.  You either play as the Taiping, a pseudo-Christian movement that is sweeping South and Central China and wishes to topple the Manchu-run government and create a new culture for China, or the Qing dynasty, an incompetent gigantic imperial administration that is trying to hold the country together and stop the momentum of the Taiping.\n\nPlayers progress through the game using cards drawn into their hand; the cards either have an event written on them or a number of Action Points, and players take turns playing cards one at a time.  Action Points allow the players to recruit armies(colored blocks), form up troops into different types of units and attack the enemy.  During the course of the game both players can call upon foreign soldiers to get the edge in battle, and the Taiping will try and meet up with rebels in nearby provinces to add manpower into their army.  Victory goes to whichever side has the most victory points at the end of the game.  Most victory points are earned by holding red city spaces at the end of turn 8, but the Qing player gets bonus points for every city never lost, and the Taiping player for every rebel piece picked up.\n\nA third Non-Playable faction exists in the game through 'The West'.  'The West' steals points from the Chinese players for every foreign unit on the board at the end of the game, randomly receives points for how much attention it is paying to China through 'The West' deck, and earns points from player card events and Chinese casualties.  It is very possible that both Chinese players will lose and the West triumphs, so Chinese players must be weary in how they utilize foreigners...\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Nicholas Coelho"], "categories": ["Wargame"], "minage": 8, "name": "The Scramble for China", "playingtime": 45, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}, {"friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "name": "wargames", "value": null}], "average": 4.5, "usersrated": 2, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 3.5, "expands": [], "numcomments": 2}, "60527": {"mechanics": ["Pattern Building", "Tile Placement"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1159383.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": ["(Uncredited)"], "id": 60527, "yearpublished": 1982, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1159383_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Piatnik"], "families": [], "description": "Dominoes variant in which the tiles contain two symbols on each side; each symbol also has a color.

Players cannot pass each other, except on the airport spaces. If a player lands exactly on top of another player, that other player is returned to his home town. In addition, on some squares a player must draw a Route Card or an Action Card that will trigger some special effect.\n\nThe assignments represent certain questions that the player is supposed to find an answer to, such as Does apartheid exist in Latin-America? When a player completes his assignment, he receives a card which contains the answer to that question.\n\nIn the advanced version of the game, General Problems are added, which concern problems that aren\u2019t linked to one of the continents. Each player receives two cards describing such a problem. Cards describing the solutions are distributed among the players. In addition to completing their assignments, the players also need to find the solution to their General Problems. Certain locations on the game board offer the option to ask another player for the solution card, as do certain Action Cards. (One of these locations is New York, as headquarters of the United Nations.)\n\nThe expert version of the game adds the United Nations Securtiy Council to the game. Players visiting New York can now call for a meeting of the Security Council. During such a meeting, the players vote on the positioning of UN Armies. These armies block player movement.

As a wealthy, well-educated aristocrat, you have travelled the world and had the fortune to enjoy your life to the fullest \u2013 but you see that history is about to change course and you know that in order to stay strong, your family must prepare well. You need to find new allies. You must absorb smaller families and use their potency to strengthen your kin. You have to arrange wise marriages, nurture strong connections at court, obtain titles, build mansions, and find the right spouses for your daughters and sons...\n\nLegacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy enables you to build a powerful dynasty in 18th century France as you step into the shoes of a French noble and compete for lasting honor. Over three generations, you \u2013 a resourceful patriarch or matriarch \u2013 will attempt to create a lasting legacy by establishing a house with ties to many different wealthy and powerful families from France and abroad (Spain, Italy, Russia and other countries).\n\nThis card game offers endless possibilities. Each time you build a family, you write a unique story, bringing to life the diverse relationships between parents and their children, between cousins, uncles, aunts, nephews and nieces. Whether you are looking for the best husband for your only daughter or a suitable wife for one of your two sons, whether you are looking to add new blood to your family by marrying into foreign nobility \u2013 you will be working to make your family rise in status through prestige and wealth, new skills and abilities.\n\nIn Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy \u2013 known previously as Nobles of Paris and winner of Ducosim Spelontwerp in 2009 \u2013 you will find 75 spouse cards with unique traits, more than twenty secret missions, nine titles, and nine \"contribution to the family\" cards. This all culminates in a highly thematic card game that will satisfy players who enjoy exploring many different paths to victory.\n\n\nLegacy is a worker placement game in which you take actions to improve the standing and/or wealth of your family. You will expand your family, creating an ever-growing tableau, the family tree. You will need to balance the three 'currencies' in the game, Prestige (converts to Honor points at the end of each generation, of which there are three), Income (your income which converts to hard cash at the end of each round, of which there are 9), and Friend cards (which are actual connections/friends, and are the only way to marry into wealthy/famous families, and can only be received through actions, such as  marrying a woman who brings some of her social contacts with her).\n\nPrestige, Income and Friend cards can be gained and lost. You can, for example, lose some prestige by marrying someone infamous or lose some Honor points (i.e. reputation) by asking friends for money. There are also numerous actions you can take that will affect one of the three 'currencies' detrimentally, such as bribing someone to get a title (for which you need to pay, but also in the loss of friends who felt they deserved that title, and not you), or the maintenance of a beautiful new park you have built for the people (losing you income). Finally, you can also take actions that result in the loss of some of your social contacts (friends), due to jealousy, or people simply no longer wanting to be associated with you.\n\nThese currencies are carefully balanced by the male and female friend cards in the game. Generally men will give you income and possibly prestige, but will cost you a dowry/wedding costs. Women, on the other hand, will give you connections (new friends you can choose from the current socialites (cards lying open on the table) and possibly prestige, and will sometimes even earn you a dowry!\n\nThe card interactions allow for multiple different paths to success, but you must choose your road strategically, planning out where you want to be headed, else you will be left behind in the dust by those with greater and more successful plans than yours.\n\n", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 2.7194, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 6.87533, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Michiel Justin Elliott Hendriks"], "categories": ["Age of Reason", "Card Game", "Economic"], "minage": 8, "name": "Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy", "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": 421}, {"friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "name": "thematic", "value": 98}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": 251}], "average": 7.29883, "usersrated": 2931, "alternative_names": ["Dziedzictwo: Testament Diuka de Crecy", "Le Testament du Duc de Cr\u00e9cy", "Das Verm\u00e4chtnis: Stammbaum der Macht"], "stddev": 1.22484, "expands": [], "numcomments": 670}, "60657": {"mechanics": ["Area Movement", "Worker Placement"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic598977.jpg", "wishing": 3, "owned": 3, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 60657, "yearpublished": 2009, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic598977_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Web published)"], "families": ["Animals: Bees"], "description": "The Bees aren\u2019t happy!

Published in Japan and written in Japanese, it is an area movement wargame focused on armored combat in 1944-45.\n\nThe game consists of three maps (two sheets printed front and back), cardboard counters, a rulebook and four unpainted PVC tanks (Tiger II, Panther, Hetzer and StuG IIIG).  The maps depict the Normandy beaches, Remagen and Budapest.  Counters depict armored vehicles for Germany, U.K., U.S.A., and U.S.S.R.\n\nThe game is a light wargame centered around the abstract depiction of armored combat in Europe late in the war.  Obviously the intent of the game designers is for the players to equip themselves with World Tank Museum forces to use on the maps; the first four vehicles (all German) are a means to jump-start these forces.  As these are generally insufficient, the included cardboard counters, which carry the attack strength, defense strength, movement value, etc., for the forces, can be used.\n\nWTD II is a successor to WTD I, but is not exactly an expansion.  Some minor changes to the forces have been made- e.g., point values for the units (which are used to build armies in design-your-own scenarios) have been adjusted.  However, several new factors are introduced, such as the inclusion of infantry, anti-tank guns, armored personnel carriers, and rules for indirect fire/air strikes.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": true, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Atsutoshi Okada"], "categories": ["Miniatures", "Wargame", "World War II"], "minage": 0, "name": "Panzertales: World Tank Division II", "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}, {"friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "name": "wargames", "value": null}], "average": 4.0, "usersrated": 1, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [{"id": 41535, "name": "Panzertales: World Tank Division I"}], "numcomments": 0}, "60806": {"mechanics": [], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic600681.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 60806, "yearpublished": 1976, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic600681_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Milton Bradley"], "families": [], "description": "Exciting game of Metric conversions!\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["Educational"], "minage": 0, "name": "Gram Cram", "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 0.0, "usersrated": 0, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 0}, "60807": {"mechanics": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic600678.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": ["(Uncredited)"], "id": 60807, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic600678_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Samuel Lowe Co."], "families": ["Animals: Bears"], "description": "Spin and move game based on the classic story.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["Children's Game"], "minage": 0, "name": "The Game of the Three Bears", "playingtime": 15, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}, {"friendlyname": "Children's Game Rank", "name": "childrensgames", "value": null}], "average": 0.0, "usersrated": 0, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 0}, "52618": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic532975.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 9, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 52618, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic532975_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Tactic"], "families": [], "description": "Children's fairy tale fascinating game!

At the special fields, keys may be collected or allied spirits recruited.\n\nCombat is resolved with a special die, which is rolled alternately by the player and by the enemy. Depending on the roll of this die, the rolling party may regain health, inflict damage or invoke special powers. These powers allow to deal more damage, regain health, collect treasure after victory etc. Each player and each enemy has three such powers, and the die roll determines which is used.\n\nDuring the game, players collect rewards like gems and tokens that increase their fighting power. They may also increase their power by recruiting an allied spirit.\n\nThe objective of the game is to collect four keys and open the treasure vault. To collect a key, a coin must be tossed when a key field of the board is reached. The coin is made of cardboard and shows either YES or NO. If the NO side comes up, the action fails and no key is found. The same mechanic is used to check if the treasure vault can be opened once it is reached with four keys - if this fails, four new keys must be collected to retry.\n\nTo hinder the success of the other players, mines can be used.

Their warring has not gone unnoticed.\n\n20 new alien cultures are now racing towards the site of the conflict. They each want to carve out their own piece of the galaxy for themselves. The aliens may be familiar to some of you (reprints of past favorites), or are aliens no one has ever seen before. The first on our list is a blast from the past; the Sniveler!\n\nIn addition, this expansion includes additions to the Cosmic Encounter universe. From the game-changing Cosmic Quakes to the bounties held within the Reward deck, these additions are sure to spice up your quest for galactic dominance.\n\nEvery game has seen five races converge to do battle for control of an empire. Now, the galaxy gets crowded. A sixth race appears to do battle, and the sixth member of your play group is able to join you. Cosmic Incursion allows a sixth player to get in on the fun.\n\nCosmic Encounter puts you in charge of the fate of an alien race. Each flavor of extraterrestrial strives to be the first to conquer five enemy colonies and establish themselves as the dominant life form. Every faction has a unique power, a power they intend to use to crush their enemies.

Each turn, you draw two cards from a common draw pile, and use these cards to form and assist your gang members. If you draw a gang member, you can add him to your gang (but have to pay him money each turn). If you draw a special ability (like drug king) or a racket (selling stolen cars, owning an illegal gaming club) you can attach it to any of your gang members. You can also happen to draw crack cards (alcoholic, drug addict, rat) that you have to attach to any of your members.\n\n\"Smugglings\" and \"heists\" usually require more gang members than you have in your gang. Team up with another gang, decide on how to split the loot, roll the die to determine success. If the hit/smuggling failed, all participants must roll the die to see if they were caught (in which case the gang members are lost). If it succeeds, all gangs involved secretly choose the card \"deal\" or \"you're fucked\" and show it to the others simultaneously. If all shows \"deal\", the loot is split according to the deal. If one of the gangs shows \"you're fucked\" he takes the lot. If two or more shows \"you're fucked\", there is a shootout, the police arrives, and no one gets anything.\n\nThere is also the option to use your gang members to kill off your opponents cronies in order to take command of their rackets or to steal their money.\n\nThe game is language level 2 or 3 borderline case.\n\n", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 1.75, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Johannes Samuelsson"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Mafia", "Negotiation"], "minage": 15, "name": "Sthlm Maffia", "playingtime": 90, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 6.45455, "usersrated": 22, "alternative_names": ["Stockholm Maffia"], "stddev": 2.12618, "expands": [], "numcomments": 8}, "52860": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Secret Unit Deployment"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic537304.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": ["Elmar Dickhoven"], "id": 52860, "yearpublished": 1986, "maxplayers": 12, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic537304_t.jpg", "publishers": ["General Games Company"], "families": [], "description": "Space War is a fast playing Space Combat and Strategy Game.

When the first player discards all of his cards, the round ends. The players who have lied down their phases get to the next phase.

World War 2 in Europe (USE) is a strategic level game covering the World War II European Theater. Players make the political decisions and control the military forces of the three major factions that struggled for European dominance and survival.\n\nWith its emphasis on force projection and decision making, players remain focused on the big picture of managing their front lines and political opportunities. Through simple mechanics and low on-map counter density, players easily handle the strategic action without a myriad of complicated subsystems or tall stacks of counters.\n\nAs one gamer put it, \"It is a delight to be spending my limited brain power on making (or agonizing over) operational decisions that are as dependent upon guts as they are gray matter. This game is not a series of arithmetic exercises, and the only variable in these algorithms is nerve.\"\n\nThough the focus is on the big picture, Unconditional Surrender! still delivers historical detail. Each country has an historical army level order of battle, and its relative economic strength and national will to fight are effectively and simply modeled. Also represented are such World War II events as airdrops, Free Forces, jets, naval evacuation, partisans, radar, railroad artillery guns, and ULTRA; all neatly woven into the game's core mechanics for ease of play\n\nThe game has many scenarios ranging from quick playing individual campaigns to longer ones covering up to the entire war.\n\nDesign Highlights\n\n     Scale: army, fleet, or air wing level units; 30-60 miles per hex; monthly turns \n     Players: 2-4\n     Playing Time: 30 minutes to 50 hours, depending on the scenario\n     Low On-Map Counter Density: The number of counters on the map is relatively low.\n     Simple Stacking: No more than one air, ground, convoy, or warship unit per hex.\n     No Factors on Counters: There are no combat or movement factors on counters.\n     Single Combat System: One combat resolution sequence and Combat Results Table covers all types of combat, yet the results differ for air/naval, ground, or strategic combat. \n     Integrated Movement/Combat System: Units move and fight in a combined activation. \n     \"Use it or Lose it\" Economic System: Simple math with minimal record keeping\n     Historical or Variable Entry: Units and events can enter play using an historical or variable time line. \n     Variable Politics: Most countries\u2019 belligerence and faction alliance is not predetermined.\n     Solitaire Friendly: Though not designed with solitaire rules, the mechanics easily allow one player to play the game.\n     PBEM Capable: The game can be played using PBEM software, but its mechanics require frequent exchanges.\n\n\n\n\nTIME SCALE:    Monthly Turns\nMAP SCALE:     30 to 40 miles per hex\nUNIT SCALE:     Army, Fleet or Wing\n\nDESIGNER: Salvatore Vasta\nDEVELOPER: Mark Dey\nMAP ART: Salvatore Vasta & Mark Simonitch\nCOUNTER ART: Charlie Kibler\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 3.5968, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 6.26114, "implementations": ["Unconditional Surrender!

The game allows players to command approximately a division each.  Individual bases represent regiments (approximately 250-500 men).  The ground scale is 1\" = 50 yds., regimental bases are 3\"x1.5\" in size.  Each turn represents 15-30 minutes of time.  The authors use 10mm miniatures, but any size figures can be used as long as the base size is maintained.\n\nDuring each turn, each brigade, division and corps HQ throws a six-sided die for activation.  Players then draw cards one by one from a deck composed of black and red cards from 1-6 plus a single joker.  Each time a card matching the dice result thrown by the HQ is drawn, elements of that HQ can activate for movement, fire, etc.  HQ's can exchange dice with the HQ above or below it, in order to seize the initiative.  When the joker is drawn, the turn ends.\n\nEach stand fires by adding its attack factor to a d10 roll; hits are caused by equalling or exceeding the target's defense factor varies with unit type and terrain.  Regiments have 3 step losses.:  when a unit takes one hit, it fires at half strength (factors are not modified, but any odd die roll is an automatic miss); on a second hit, fire is at half strength and units may fire only on black cards; on the third hit, the unit is eliminated.  Long range fire cannot cause hits, only morale checks.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Christopher Palmer", "John R. \"Buck\" Surdu", "David Wood"], "categories": ["American Civil War", "Miniatures", "Wargame"], "minage": 10, "name": "A Union So Tested:  Look, Sarge, No Charts American Civil War", "playingtime": 300, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 0.0, "usersrated": 0, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 1}, "61491": {"mechanics": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Movement", "Paper-and-Pencil", "Role Playing"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic602362.jpg", "wishing": 10, "owned": 35, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": ["Robertson Sondoh, Jr."], "id": 61491, "yearpublished": 2009, "maxplayers": 1, "numweights": 5, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic602362_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Web published)", "Experimental Playground"], "families": ["Solitaire Games"], "description": "The world is in turmoil!

The idea was to create a set of skirmish rules that were quick to play, fun, colourful and different to other rule sets. We wanted to play games featuring mythical warriors such as Robin Hood, Achilles and King Arthur, and historical legends like Alexander of Macedon, Frederick Barbarossa and William the Conqueror.\n\nThe focus of development was therefore to create rules that favoured the heroes and legends of past centuries at the expense of the common soldier. Death or Glory (DoG) does this, and makes such heroes and legends quite literally deadly on the tabletop. BUT, and this is a big but, they are not unbeatable. If you charge King Arthur into a unit of enemy warriors on his own, with no support or strategy and it\u2019s going to hurt - or could even be fatal! But use him as he should be, a legendary fighter, and he will carve his away around a battlefield - just as he does in the movies.\n\nThe idea is to use DoG to re-enact scenes from a movie, book or graphic novel, or make up your own encounters using lots of models. Whether you have Leonidas cutting a path through Persian Immortals to save an injured companion, or Jason trying to fight his way through skeletons to the safety of his ship, DoG is perfect for recreating such encounters.\n\nThis rulebook loosely covers the Dark Ages, as the statistic cards that are provided are for fairly generic European warriors with chain armour and large shields. There are also two specific lists with statistic cards for Norse and Saxon warriors. Additional supplements and/or downloads will be made available from the Downloads section of this web site.\n\nThe DoG rules have now been fully playtested and are being designed, ready for printing. We anticipate that shops will have stock of the rule book in late 2009. DoG will be a full colour, perfect bound 96-page book.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Neil Fawcett"], "categories": ["Ancient", "Medieval", "Mythology", "Wargame"], "minage": 8, "name": "Death or Glory", "playingtime": 90, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}, {"friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "name": "wargames", "value": null}], "average": 0.0, "usersrated": 0, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 0}, "61613": {"mechanics": ["Acting", "Memory"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic605366.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 2, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": ["Mirko Suzuki"], "id": 61613, "yearpublished": 2009, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic605366_t.jpg", "publishers": ["KOSMOS"], "families": ["Celebrities: Astrid Lindgren", "Characters: Pippi Longstocking"], "description": "There are task cards which show four of the five pictures in the game.

They both want to launch a new product into the market, for which they need the same intermediate product. Step by step you conceptualize this intermediate product by collecting the right cards and placing them on the board. Be careful though, because every player is approached by different manufacturers and will do everything to get control over the intermediate product, which appears on the board.\n\nExplanation\n\nConceptualize This! is a card game in which every player gets a unique target. During the game you try to collect cards which \"connect\" to each other in a dominos like way. The set of cards you collect results in a concept of the intermediate product, build up out of different components that need each other to function. The board supports the concept of tile (card) placement in such a way that the connections between the cards are made visible. The game is won by the player who completes his / her concept of the intermediate product on the board.\n\nBackground\n\nThe development on this board game started as an element of a Bachelor thesis. For the research in this thesis the board game was meant to educate people on how to model UML activity diagrams (a diagram in which the necessities and results of a series of actions are modelled) in a fast and easy way. During the creation of the board game the accent moved to a system diagram (a diagram in which the necessities and results of a series of components are modelled) which gave more freedom in the creation of cards. Because the concepts used in both modelling languages are the same, people should still be able to create an activity diagram after playing the game.\n\nAt first the game seemed to have a very high luck rate, but closer to completion the game turned out to be tactical as well.

Now the first Thunderstone has been discovered in the Dungeons of Grimhold and the Doom Knights have sent their minions to claim the relic. The Villagers of Barrowsdale gather brave souls to face the dungeon and keep the Thunderstone out of the hands of the Doom Knights.\n\nThunderstone is a fantasy deck-building game much in the style of Dominion. Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomnly chosen that players may add to their specific decks. Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards. In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon.\n\nA dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters together. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types so players will have to take this into account when they choose what to buy.\n\nRather than buying puny Victory Points, player's will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. Players may on their turn choose to attack a monster in the deck rather than visit town and buy cards. If they do this they play cards from their hand and resolve their abilities in order to boost strength and have enough light to reach a specific monster. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards. In addition to this players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions. The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it. The player with the most victory points in their deck is the winner.\n\nThe basic Thunderstone framework was updated in the implementation of Thunderstone: Advance.\n\nIntegrates with\n\n\n    Thunderstone Advance: Towers of Ruin\n    Thunderstone: Dragonspire\n    Thunderstone: Starter Set\n\n\n", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 2.505, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 6.85518, "implementations": ["Thunderstone Advance: Numenera", "Thunderstone Advance: Towers of Ruin", "Thunderstone: Starter Set"], "designers": ["Mike Elliott"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Fantasy", "Fighting"], "minage": 12, "name": "Thunderstone", "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": 446}, {"friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "name": "thematic", "value": 124}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": 303}], "average": 7.01702, "usersrated": 8863, "alternative_names": ["Kamie\u0144 Gromu", "\u0413\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044c", "\u30b5\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3", "\u96f7\u9706\u4e4b\u77f3"], "stddev": 1.45383, "expands": [], "numcomments": 2068}, "53966": {"mechanics": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic538193.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 53966, "yearpublished": 2001, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic538193_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Hershey"], "families": ["Promotional Board Games"], "description": "Players move their tokens around a board decorated with Hershey's candies in an effort to collect enough candies to win the game.

Player can also modify the movement, capture or interaction with opposing piece of a piece in play by paying the cost of a Piece Modifier Action card. The effects of the modification lasts only the turn the card is played. Unsummoned pieces are in each player\u2019s reserve. When the pieces are captured (or destroyed), they are placed in each player\u2019s graveyard.\n\nThere are 2 types of cards. Actions go to the discard pile face up immediately while Permanents stay in play in front of the player who played them. Kings cannot be targeted or affected by cards unless specified. Player may not Check the opponent if he plays any card prior to his Move.\n\nEach 2x2 board tile has a coloured circle in one of the squares. The circle indicates the square as a terrain of that colour. At the beginning of a player\u2019s turn, if his pieces occupy all 4 terrains of his own colour, he can draw 1 more card.\n\nDiscussion forum can be found here\nhttp://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3869101#3869101\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Chen Changcai"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Card Game", "Print & Play"], "minage": 12, "name": "ChessCraft", "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}, {"friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "name": "abstracts", "value": null}], "average": 0.0, "usersrated": 0, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 0}, "54137": {"mechanics": ["Area Enclosure", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1887253.jpg", "wishing": 349, "owned": 2195, "expansions": [], "trading": 44, "artists": ["Andrea Femerstrand"], "id": 54137, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 77, "wanting": 89, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1887253_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Blue Orange (EU)", "Blue Orange Games", "Foxgames (Poland)", "GoKids \u73a9\u6a02\u5c0f\u5b50", "HUCH! & friends", "Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.", "Lautapelit.fi", "L\u00fadilo"], "families": ["3D Games", "Animals: Sheep"], "description": "In Battle Sheep (first released as Splits), players start the game by constructing the board from identical four-hex tiles, then each player places his/her tall stack of discs on one of the border hexes.

At the end of each round, gain  points for cards in your mountain and delta.\n\nThe basic rules introduce the four player actions: Weathering,  Hillslope, Fluvial, and Draw Cards. The advanced rules add details: atmospheric change, ice  ages, glaciers, flood volcanism, quakes, etc.\n\nMountains are far more dynamic than the limitations of human  lifetimes would suggest. Their growth and death involve cycles that keep the planet habitable. The machinery of these cycles is called erosion: the weathering of rock and its transport to the sea. Once there, it is subducted into the mantle, where volcanoes return the silicates, sulfates, water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen to the surface.\n\nAlmost every step of the erosion process is catalyzed by water. For instance, in your turn you may weather rock using crystallization (busting rock by growing evaporated salt crystals), then transport the remains to the River using creep (movement propelled by wet/dry and freeze/thaw cycles). Once plunked in the River, the eroded material is moved as sediment to the sea. Braided rivers carry the maximum sediment load, but they are the least stable (and the trickiest to play).\n\nThe role of erosion in atmosphere control is often overlooked. Every mountain is a titanic terraformer and greenhouse gas scrubber. Weathering removes 100 billion tons of oxygen and 800 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the air each year. Although the biological functions of respiration and decay contribute more to the atmosphere than erosion, during many past episodes it was the other way around. Left unchecked, a major orogenic (mountain-building) event removes so much CO2 that the oceans would freeze over in less than an Erosion game turn (6 million years, the same scale as for the game American Megafauna). On the other hand, a major flood volcano such as the Deccan Traps has poured hundreds of trillions of tons of CO2 back into the air,  dwarfing the outputs of all human industry combined.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0385, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 5.65716, "implementations": [], "designers": ["John C.

The strategy is not so easy: the Allies must hold on to protect the Suez Canal; the Axis must choke off this vital waterway.

So, can you find the right balance between the ferocious partisan war of the wilderness and the more \u201ccivilized\u201d style of war as practiced in Europe?  If so, then perhaps the Marquis de Montcalm, with his French battalions, can stave off his more numerous enemies to the south; perhaps New France can survive the tempest of war.\n\nAs the English, you, too, have a difficult \u201cbalancing\u201d act to master; you must find a way to placate and protect your fiercely independent, but extremely valuable Colonials.  Without their numbers and forest craft, you stand little chance of besting the potent combination of \u201cunmitigated savages\u201d from the Lakes, Mission Indians from the St. Lawrence Valley, Canadian bush rangers, and French battalions which will be coming at you in waves.  Ask too much of the Americans; do too little on their behalf; treat them with disrespect; they will turn a deaf ear to your entreaties and allow the British Regulars to march off to certain defeat out there, at the hands of a foe who is covered \u201cby the universal forest.\u201d\n\nAnd, facing both of you, is \u201can immense uninhabited wilderness, overgrown everywhere with trees and brushwood, so that nowhere can one see twenty yards.\u201d  This vast, uncharted forest dominates the struggle.  Ultimately, victory will only go to that player who can conquer that savage landscape stretching out before him.

All of this history packed into just 60 minutes of fun!\n\nThe game uses a simple differential (+1, +2, etc.) battle system with plenty of opportunities for both sides to attack and maneuver.

On your turn, roll two dice (sides show one of the lemming colors) then choose to move one of those lemmings (if one is out of the race, move the lemming in last place). Lemmings may move one track section at a time, to any unoccupied space in the next section. The spaces on the race track are one of several types (e.g., give a lemming concrete shoe; 2=dead, remove concrete, allow you to place bets, move a lemming, etc.).\n\nBetting is interesting: each time, you have the option to bet. To do so, place a lemming card face down on top of your stack of bet cards; goal is to place winner on TOP of your stack (last bet placed).\n\nThe game ends when a lemming reaches the finish; place remaining lemmings in the order they are on the track. Mission cards score bonus VP if completed, or cost VP if failed. Then resolve bets: turn over your cards, then go through them getting 1 VP per card revealed until you get to winning lemming (max 6 VP).\n\n", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 1.431, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 5.81231, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Michael Rieneck"], "categories": ["Dice", "Novel-based"], "minage": 8, "name": "Lemming Mafia", "playingtime": 20, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": 2851}, {"friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "name": "partygames", "value": 184}, {"friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "name": "familygames", "value": 797}], "average": 6.19448, "usersrated": 757, "alternative_names": ["Lemming Maffia", "Nichtlustig: Lemming-Mafia", "\u041c\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f \u041b\u0435\u043c\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0433\u043e\u0432"], "stddev": 1.32699, "expands": [], "numcomments": 192}, "54736": {"mechanics": [], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic544512.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 54736, "yearpublished": 2008, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic544512_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Vivid Imaginations"], "families": [], "description": "An electronic board game based on the BBC show of the same name.

You never use both halves of the card at once \u2014 either one or the other.\n\nA turn consists of first playing a card to cover the shot your opponent played, then playing another card to dictate which of the six zones you'll hit the ball to. Finally, you play a preparation card, indicating which zones you're prepared to cover. The preparation card can be used to cover a shot if the appropriate zone is highlighted; otherwise you must cover the shot with a card from your hand, in which case the preparation card becomes the attack. Thus, by playing cards that your opponent cannot cover with her preparation card, you maintain control of the match because you'll see from where the next attack will come and will be able to prepare for that. Of course if a player cannot cover a shot at all, then the point is lost.\n\nCombinations of cards can create special shots, which if not covered by the corresponding combination of cards, leave a player off balance, with her drawing only one card at the end of the turn instead of the usual two.

Bailout! The Game is anything but an ordinary ride along the tracks. The banks must obtain a continual flow of debt and have greatest unsustainable losses in order to win the game.\n\nBanks bombard each other with sales and acquisitions.  The transactions are a vital part of the game; every decision a bank makes can affect every other bank.  Banks try desperately to manipulate their stock holdings for their own benefit. If they are not careful there stock may fall into the hands of a rival or vise versa.  The continued interaction drastically changes the outcome of the game right up until the end.\n\nBailout! The Game: Made in America with partially recycled materials. This game has classic American styling. Perfect for family game night or playing with friends.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Jordy Sopourn", "Shari Sopourn"], "categories": ["Economic", "Humor", "Political"], "minage": 14, "name": "Bailout!

Each player starts with a set of 16 tokens referred to as stones; one light set and one dark set. The board is placed between players so that there are seven rows and eight columns. To start the game, each player takes a set of stones and stacks two stones on each of their eight home cells; their nearest row. The Roman player uses the light set and goes first. The Gaul player uses the dark set. Players alternate turns.\n\nThe basic units of the game are towers and walls. A tower consists of two like-colored stones in a cell. A wall is a single stone in a cell. Only towers move. The main function of walls is to block the opponent's movement and secondarily they act as stepping stones which can be used later on to create new towers. Towers move by sowing as in Mancala with a stacking limit of two and only like-colored stones may be stacked. Each of the destination cells must be empty or contain a friendly wall. Tower stones can be used to remove adjacent opponent walls. This is done by sacrifice! Material remains equal throughout the game but slowly erodes for both players as players defuse threats. A player is stalemated if unable to move/sow or sacrifice at the start of his or her turn. Going flat out (stalemating yourself) in order to stalemate your opponent can be very satisfying.\n\nMurus Gallicus is a game of balance, space and timing. Players must balance defense and offense. By controlling the board's center, a player can gain mobility. Players must wait for the right moment to squeeze through the opponent's defense. The endgame can be very tense thanks to the balance in material.\n\nThere are several useful structures players can employ. The Gallic Wall consisting of orthogonally connected walls (and sometimes towers) requires the opponent to go around the wall or blast his or her way thorough using a sacrificed stone. The Chariot consists of a tower, wall and empty space aligned. By sowing the towers stones in the direction of the wall, the two-celled formation glides forward. The battering ram consists of two towers and an opponent wall aligned. By sacrificing a tower stone, the opponent's wall can be removed. The remaining chariot formation can then move through the breach on the player's next turn. Lastly, a siege tower is a tower sitting within striking distance of the opponent's home row. Such a tower can tie up many of your opponent's pieces.\n\nThe true excitement of the game is in the playing. A sneak attack that squeezes through a breach or a well-timed all out assault can be quite satisfying.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 3.4286, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 5.61077, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Phil Leduc"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "minage": 10, "name": "Murus Gallicus", "playingtime": 20, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": 5288}, {"friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "name": "abstracts", "value": 192}], "average": 7.688, "usersrated": 50, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 1.22191, "expands": [], "numcomments": 27}, "55149": {"mechanics": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic547667.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 2, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 55149, "yearpublished": 1990, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic547667_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Baron/Scott"], "families": [], "description": "\"YOUR TICKET TO THE HOTTEST NEW ROCK & ROLL GAME\"\n\nFrom the back of the box (which also doubles as the rule \"book\"):\nObject: To be the first person to advance through the Rock Fever concert seating to the stage and receive a backstage pass.\nCOMPONENTS:    * 4 Rock Fever Manuals    * 4 Pawns    * 1 Game Board    * 1 Backstage Pass    * 1 Die (6 sided)\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Scott Baron"], "categories": ["Music", "Trivia"], "minage": 0, "name": "Rock Fever", "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 5.0, "usersrated": 1, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 0}, "55150": {"mechanics": ["Area Movement", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Partnerships", "Role Playing", "Tile Placement", "Variable Player Powers"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic551015.jpg", "wishing": 199, "owned": 2812, "expansions": [], "trading": 114, "artists": ["Alex Aparin", "Dimitri Bielak (I)", "Yoann Boissonnet", "Jason Caffoe", "Felicia Cano", "Anna Christenson", "Jesper Ejsing", "Raymond Gaustadnes", "Johannes Holm", "Henning Ludvigsen", "Chris Maldior", "John Moriarty", "Andrew Navaro", "Zoe Robinson", "Amanda Sartor", "Brian Schomburg", "WiL Springer", "Frank Walls"], "id": 55150, "yearpublished": 2009, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 35, "wanting": 52, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic551015_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Edge Entertainment", "Fantasy Flight Games", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Stupor Mundi"], "families": ["Campaign Games", "Descent", "The Realms of Terrinoth"], "description": "The Sea of Blood expansion allows players to take their Descent games to the high seas.\n\nNew board sections include large expansive ocean tiles with scattered islands, as well as large ship decks with additional tiles featuring ships' cannons.\n\nThe expansion includes an expansive overworld map featuring new sea areas and island locations to explore.\n\nThe expansion also features new sea journey rules and adventures, as well as equipment and treasure cards and additional tuck boxes for packing the game away during longer campaigns.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 3.4, "expansion": true, "bayesaverage": 6.24305, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Sally Karkula", "Robert A.

For example one with the name \u201cTour the France Cycliste \u201c in the Fifties.\n\nIt is a simple game of goose where a cycling game is played along the outer track of the game board and on the other hand a (initially) tourist car game on the track with the map of France. In the original game cyclists, small cars and bonus cards were provided.\n\nWhit this version comes only the game board and the game rules.\n\nIn the version of the years ' 50 the layout of the game board has been preserved, but the characters and symbolism has been adapted to the era. Also the rules have been strongly simplified.

This can be done as a Solo player or with any number of players controlling and arguing over the party members.  (I have run one of my D&D groups through it with 8 people as the party)\nYour Adventuring Party is made up of 5 Unique and Specific Classes that must be represented as you begin the game.  Each class has a Hero that Begins at Level 1 and can advance up to Level 5 during game play.  Most 1st level Heroes need 3xp to advance to level two. 7xp more to advance to level three, 10-15 more to level four, and 18-24 to level five. This depends on the class and individual Hero.\nHere is a list of the 19 Heroes that we have at this time and what they are at each level.\nProtection Class:\nGriff - Journeyman - Fighter - Warrior - Barbarian - Berserker\nSonya - Wanderer - Explorer - Questing - Paladin - Angel\nOlli - Son of Hamfast - Pikeman - Squire - Knight - Crusader\nSolarion - Footman - Swordsman - Lieutentant - Captain - General\nDeath Class:\nSelene - Outlaw - Bandit - Thief - Rogue - Shadow\nGabriel - Urchin - of the Streets - Minstrel - Bard - Muse\nGrimm - Outlaw - Bandit - Enforcer - Assassin - Reaper\nSabban - Rebel - Renegade - Deciever - Deserter - Betrayer\nNature Class:\nRichard - Farmer - Woodsman - Guide - Scout - Ranger\nIsseili - the Fey - Forester - Naturalist - Druid - Warden\nVenr - Awakened - Scavenger - Hungering - Feasting - Vampire\nMagic Class:\nMarteel - Novice - Adept - Wizard - Mage - Archmage\nCallius - Novice - Adept - Cultist - Warlock - Demon\nZaphian - Underling - Adept - Sorcerer - Necromancer - Lich\nRymar - Stonehead - Preserved - Protected - Encased - Fortified\nLife Class;\nDana - Follower - Acolyte - Healer - Priestess - High Priestess\nJesse - Follower - Acolyte - Brother - Preacher - Martyr\nSarah - Searching - Enlightened - Forgiving - Redeemed - Guardian Spirit\nMary - Acolyte - Cleric - Devoted - Blessed - Saint\n\nThe Adventure consists of a 60 card Dungeon, which has one Quest Objective, Terrain, Creatures, Equipment, Effects, Fast Effects, Events, and other Items.  There are always two Unigue Tier Creature Cards that can be interchanged after completion of each Tier to make the adventure last longer and become more difficult.  The eight Adventures that we have complete are listed below with the amount of games played, completion rate, and Quest Objective.\nGoblin Kingdom -    71/120     60%    Goblin King\nDead Marshes -      58/90       63%    Lord of the Undead\nDemonic Rift -          35/63       54%    Balor              \nRuby Mountain -      31/64       49%    Ancient Red Dragon\nForsaken City -        25/51       50%    King of the Streets\nNature's Abundance 23/50      46%    Ancient Treant\nDangerous Seas -    21/47       38%    Captain Davy Jones\nTomb Kingdom -      17/50       34%    Tomb King\nWe are planning on a total of 10 adventures to become available in the future.\n        \nGame-play:\nIn Quest: A New Age there are Abilities, Upgrades, and four stat Values -- Accuracy, Armor, Life, and Damage. \nAbilities differ for each Hero and Creature according to their assigned value in the game, (e.g. a Goblin Recruit has no abilities and is worth 1 point value, while a Goblin Captain has a value of 3 and grants abilities to other Goblins).\n5 levels of Upgrade are available to each Hero and are earned in the Dungeon as the party delves deeper into the adventure. As you gain XP from Terrain, Trap, and Creature cards, you can spend the XP to make your Heroes stronger. \nAccuracy is the Hero or Creatures base accuracy which you then combine with a roll of a D20 to attempt to hit.\nArmor is the Hero or Creatures base defense against attacks.\nLife is the Hero or Creatures base damage that they can take before dying.\nDamage is the Hero or Creatres base damage they can inflict against another.\n Phases of the Game:\n1)  Quest Deck - Turn over the appropiate amount of cards.  Fast Effects happen at this time and can change how many cards are turned over.\n2)  Effects - Any Effects that are turned over happen at this time.\n3)  Hero1 - All Heroes have one action per turn, which can be used to either Attack, Heal, Pick Up and item or attempt to Disarm a trap.  The Hero may also Hold their action for Hero2 phase.\n4)  Dungeon - Any surviving Creatures may perform one action at this time.\n5)  Hero2 - The Heroes that held their action can now act.\n6)  Events - Events such as traps that have not been disarmed and other Events take place at this time.\n7)  End of Turn - End of Turn abilities such as Regenerate and Aura's take place at this time.\n8)  Upgrade - XP that has been collected can now be used to upgrade your Heroes.  When a Hero is upgraded they gain full health.  Once XP has been spent on a Hero, it cannot be used again.\nStart the Phases over at this time.\n The game begins by shuffling your Quest Deck and turning over three cards.  As the game progresses and your Heroes are upgraded, you start to turn over more cards to make the Adventure more difficult.  The Breakdown is as follows:\nGame Begins - 3 Cards per turn\nAfter Two Hero Upgrades - 4 Cards per turn\nAfter Five Hero Upgrades - 5 Cards per turn\nAfter Eight Hero Upgrades - 6 Cards per turn\nAfter Ten Hero Upgrades - 7 Cards per turn\nAfter Twelve Hero Upgrades - 8 cards per turn\n Rules Questions:\n1)  When Attacking you take the Accuracy and add a D20 roll. That roll must equal or beat the targets Armor.  You do not have to roll when Healing or using an Ability unless it is used as an attack.\n2)  Melee characters cannot target Ranged characters unless all other Melee opponents are defeated.\n3)  Rolls of a 1 are considered an Epic Fail and always miss.  Rolls of 20 are considered a Critical Strike and always hit, in addition a Critical causes Double damage to the target.\n4)  All XP this is collected goes into a community pool which can be used at the direction of the Party's controller or controller's.\n5)  As an overall rule: The Cant's outweigh the Can's\n\nWe did a short Demo on youtube which is quite boring but you are free to take a look at the mechanics of the game. :)\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/HiddenKeep#play/all/uploads-all/1/hDXivVltVB4\n\n", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["David Lindsay"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Fantasy"], "minage": 10, "name": "Quest: A New Age", "playingtime": 20, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 0.0, "usersrated": 0, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 0}, "55391": {"mechanics": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic557039.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 3, "expansions": [], "trading": 1, "artists": [], "id": 55391, "yearpublished": 1994, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic557039_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Smartplay Pty Ltd"], "families": [], "description": "The first-aid and safety game for all ages.\n\"Pick a playing piece and race your opponents around the outer board to enter the wheel.

At the beginning of the game, each player only knows its own identity. Thus, the game has two objectives: to win more points by moving the pawns (the game ends when someone reaches 42 points) and earn additional points, by discovering the identity of other agents (this is done, once someone reaches 32 points, placing numbered chips into the slots of the forecasts bases).\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["Deduction", "Spies/Secret Agents"], "minage": 7, "name": "Sabotagem", "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 0.0, "usersrated": 0, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 1}, "55663": {"mechanics": ["Tile Placement"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2689189.jpg", "wishing": 45, "owned": 42, "expansions": [], "trading": 4, "artists": ["Cameron Browne"], "id": 55663, "yearpublished": 2009, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 3, "wanting": 17, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2689189_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Web published)", "nestorgames"], "families": ["Moon/Lunar"], "description": "Rebel Moon Defense is a fast-playing game for two, inspired by the Tower Defense genre.\n\nThe imperials have discovered the last rebel outpost on a moon colony surrounded by an asteroid belt, and launched a devastating Chaos Bomb to destroy it.

The settlement phase is an intricate civilization building game in which you spend very limited resources to build buildings, research new technologies, train your warriors, and set up your strategy for survival.  During the hunt, you'll encounter a series of stories in a \"choose your own adventure\" style journey through various events and encounters.  Finally, when you meet the monster you're pursuing, you'll engage it in an a massive arena-style battle where only one party is going to survive.  If your party lives, you'll be able to bring the spoils back home to use in expanding your settlement.\n\nMonster AI System\nEach of the 7 monsters included are controlled by their own pair of decks that scale to 3 levels of difficulty (except for the final encounter, which has only 1 level and it's HARD!). Every encounter, even with the same monster, is highly variable and no two showdowns will resolve the same way. Players will have to plan their gear and keep their minds sharp to prevail.\n\nGear System\nIn Kingdom Death: Monster, survivors will craft gear from resources earned from defeating monsters or found on their hunt. Each survivor has a 3x3 gear grid. Selection and arrangement of your gear cards is critical, as many provided bonuses and activate special rules when aligned correctly.\n\nStory Event System\n40+ Story Events plus over 100 hunt encounters will shape and guide your campaign. Story Events detail important evolutions in your civilization, introduce new monsters, and provide rich detail for your campaign.  Some will trigger automatically as you progress through the campaign, but most will be entirely based on choices players make.\n\nStory Events cover everything from setting up and fighting a monster to key events that happen within the overall story.

You earn a point by reaching certain numbers along tracks, such as at least 7 on the influence track or 8 on the majority track. You also may earn a point by beating your secretly assigned archenemy on three specified tracks.\n\nThe game lasts a number of rounds, with each round consisting of a directors' meeting, followed by 4-7 turns. At the meeting, the \"company chairman\" is replaced (the next token in line moves up) and the \"division heads\" are named (by seeing who has the majority in each column of placed cubes). Chairmen and heads get salary bonuses and a card detailing a single advantage for the cardholder.\n\nThe player who's the \"communications\" head then secretly looks at the Event cards and determines in which order they will be played (and so how many turns will be in the current round). Other heads' cards will let them pay less for stocks, for example, or place or remove bits.\n\nAfter each event card is revealed, players select one action to perform, such as \"hiring and relocating employees\" (placing or moving cubes), resigning as a department head, using an advantage card, or bribing players for their advantage cards. These actions result in points on the scoring tracks and sometimes money (which is only used for bribery and buying blocks of stock). A bribed card has more power than an earned one, giving incentive to accept bribes (the card is less useful or even useless to the original owner, depending on the workers' happiness scale). In addition to bribery getting you a power you want, it also moves you up the corruption track. A player who rejects a bribe, however, loses one cube on the majority columns.\n\nIt's not a business simulation, and gameplay isn't as dastardly as the theme implies. The event cards provide most of the humor.

The game covers the Nanboku-cho period of Japanese history and simulates one of the most dynamic and important periods in Japanese history.\n\nFrom 1336-1392, all of Japan was aflame with war. After the fall of a corrupt and ineffective emperor, the two great courts of Japan dueled to determine the future ruler of the country. Warriors of Japan covers the vital period following the destruction of the Kamakura shogunate and the fight to find a successor.\n\nPlayers of Warriors of God will find much familiar here, however, unlike the enormous time period covered in Warriors of God, Warriors of Japan covers only 4 years. Subtle changes in the system to cover this unique period have been exchanged in Warriors of Japan. For example, Leaders no longer die from old age but rather can switch sides unexpectedly during a combat. Subtle changes in the movement and combat rules will add to the strategy to a greater extent than in Warriors of God. A random game start generator will keep each game fresh and interesting. Warriors of Japan also brings us home to our wargaming roots.

For example, Cao Cao starts the game at Chen Liu and owning that deed.\n             In addition, the colored set corresponding to the starting property of that pawn is also free to purchase for that pawn when landing on it. For example, Cao Cao can buy any blue property (including Chen Liu if he ever lost it, Shou Chun, or Xia Pi) for free when landing on it and no one owns it.\n        \n         No bonus for completing a colored set.\n             Unlike monopoly, you can start building \"houses\" (camps in this game) even w/o collecting a complete colored set.  However, you can only build them when you land on a property and only on that property.\n             Only 3 houses before a \"hotel\" (city [walls] in this game).\n        \n         Free parking space replaced by a Shrine space where if you land on it, any accumulated money in that space is split between the player that landed on it and the bank at around 50/50.\n         Jail/Just visiting space replaced by maintenance space\n             Each player pays 200 taels [aka gold] per property owned (doesn't matter about houses).  \n             Player who pays the LEAST money from this gets a free camp built on a property of their choice.  Money paid for maintenance goes to the shrine space.\n        \n         Go to Jail space replaced by a Disaster Aid space. \n             Each player pays 10% rounded down to the nearest 100 taels of their current cash on hand to the shrine space.  \n             The player that pays the MOST money from this gets a free camp built on a property of their choice.\n        \n         Community Chest cards are called Secret Pouches (ala Zhuge Liang) and are generally somewhat more powerful than in Monopoly, though some are still weak as well.\n         Chance spaces replaced by a Tavern space where you can recruit officers to join you.  \n             Only 3 officers are displayed at a time and these 3 are replaced whether or not you recruit one after landing on a Tavern Space.\n             Each player can recruit a total of 3 officers, which each officer having a special passive ability specific to that officer.  For example, Diao Chan forces an opponent paying rent to you to pay an additional 1500.  Lu Bu allows you to not pay any rent for landing on a space, but after using him, you must put him back at the bottom of the officer draw deck.  \n             There are a total of 30 officers to choose from.\n        \n         After a player goes bankrupt, that player actually submits to the player that caused the bankruptcy.  \n             The bankrupt player is now considered a Subordinate while his master is considered the \"New Ruler\".  \n             They share resources, officers, and properties. The New Ruler essentially gets to move two pawns per turn instead of one, with the Subordinate rolling his own moves but the results of the space the Subordinate's pawn landing on being resolved by the New Ruler.  \n             This keeps the subordinate tied to the game instead of being completely eliminated.  When the ruler wins, the subordinate gets second place.  \n             There can be multiple levels of subordinates as a result of cascading bankruptcies etc. \n        \n         The game is won when only one ruler is left and the rest are his subordinates.\n    \n\n\nOverall, a more complex game than monopoly, especially cause of the officer cards and the somewhat more powerful community chest.  Also, the free camps from the maintenance and disaster aid spaces promote hoarding of cash while developing only a few properties normally.  Easily expandable to 6, 7, or 8 players, really. Though that'll increase the game length dramatically, of course.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.5, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Jia-Yu Lin", "Chia-Yu Lin"], "categories": ["Dice"], "minage": 6, "name": "Monopoly of Three Kingdoms", "playingtime": 50, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 6.71429, "usersrated": 7, "alternative_names": ["\u5927\u5bcc\u7fc1\u4e09\u570b\u7fa4\u82f1\u6703"], "stddev": 0.880631, "expands": [], "numcomments": 0}, "55896": {"mechanics": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Point to Point Movement"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic554057.jpg", "wishing": 19, "owned": 92, "expansions": [], "trading": 9, "artists": ["WhisperTalkAndScream"], "id": 55896, "yearpublished": 2009, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 16, "wanting": 4, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic554057_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Giuoco"], "families": ["Country: The Netherlands"], "description": "Koplopers en Dwarsliggers\n\nThe game Koplopers en Dwarsliggers puts the players in charge of their own railway company.

For these passengers the journey from Rotterdam to Amsterdam may well go via Eindhoven.\n\nSometimes there is a sudden change of direction when the train has picked up more passengers, and a majority of those want to go to another part of the country.

Or will they not make it at all, because of those annoying obstructions?\n\nIntroduction to the game\nIn Koplopers en Dwarsliggers every player may construct up to three trains and each of those trains can transport up to 500 passengers. During the game you pick up passengers at stations and put their tokens at your train organizer card in the corresponding box. And then you try to transport your passengers to their destinations, after which you collect their tokens in your tray. Each turn you may spend five action points that you can use for constructing or scrapping trains, but you may also combine trains, split them up again, or reverse them.

The new Result card is placed on top of the current Result card.\n\nContinue playing until either the Poker draw pile or the Result draw pile runs out.

The Japanese expansion reaches its limit in the archipelago of the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. The Japanese initial force, the Army of the South Seas, began to expand reducing the boundaries of the Australian defenses from its base in Rabaul, the logistic center of Japanese control in the zone.\nThe naval-air battle of the Coral Sea was a hard blow for the Japanese force since the Soho, their light aircraft carrier, was sunk, and the amphibious invasion force destined to take Port Moresby had to return to Rabaul without fulfilling their mission. Afterwards the imperial forces tried to take Port Moresby by a ground assault, extending their way along the Solomon Islands creating air bases and observation stations throughout the archipelago.\nThe Japanese forces were thus threatening naval communications between the United States and Australia.  In response, the Allies reinforced Australia and the New Caledonia zone looking for an opportunity to counterattack and to stop the imperial tide extending through the region. The return to Australia of veteran units from the Middle East allowed the Allies to initiate an offensive in Papua/New Guinea that would last six bloody months and result in the Allied recovery of the enclaves of Buna and Gona on the North coast of New Guinea.\n\nIn the Solomon Islands the North American counterattack began August 8th, 1942 and led to a lasting and bloody campaign through February 1943, with successive attacks and counterattacks of both sides resulting in Guadalcanal Island back in American hands. In addition to the ground forces, the region saw much use of air and naval operations.  Both navies accomplished herculean tasks to support their respective ground forces and supply them.  Their importance was noticeable, so air attacks on navies were numerous, and expensive in lives, planes and ships.  The last of them in this period was the battle of the Sea of Bismarck, which resulted in Allied air supremacy in the region.\nThe Japanese Imperial navy based on the island of Truk made several raids in the region to support the small naval forces in the South Seas. But eventually the Japanese had to yield the initiative to the allies in the region as they exhausted their resources, fighting on two fronts.  The Allies exhausted the Japanese offensive, and they prepare to take their own offensive.\n\nThe game is developed in an operational scale \u2013 area-based map with a scale 1:300,000.  It is designed for two players with one running the JAPANESE forces and the other the ALLIED forces. The game lasts approximately 3-4 hours and uses a two sided system to handle the mechanics of play: cards and counters.  The players will have to use their troops and their resources to obtain victory points while eliminating enemy forces and occupying cities in the map. It is not a card driven game as the cards are used to bring about events that influence battles, secure reinforcements, and provide resources with which to carry on the fight.\n\nIn the beginning of the game the JAPANESE player will take the Initiative and will have to expand throughout the map to secure Victory Points. The ALLIED player is on the defensive, and will have to strength his forces as the game progresses. He will have to take advantage of every opportunity to inflict damage on the advancing Japanese forces.  The island of Guadalcanal will be crucial as the game develops, as are the results of actions in Papua/New Guinea.   \nThe JAPANESE player must face the historical dilemma of concentrating on taking the Solomon Islands, Papua or both simultaneously.  The ALLIED player will have to be patient and force his opponent to extend himself, by accumulating forces and to committing lethal offensives that put the forces of the Empire of the Rising Sun in check. \nLike all the games of this Series, the rules are simple and straight forward.  Our objective was to create games that are very interactive, and offer players a pleasant creative experience.  We aim for solid games for players who do not have the time or the space to leave a game setup and in place over a long period of play.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.4118, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 5.64177, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Francisco Ronco"], "categories": ["Nautical", "Wargame", "World War II"], "minage": 10, "name": "Coral Sea: Campaign Commander Volume II", "playingtime": 180, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": 4645}, {"friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "name": "wargames", "value": 781}], "average": 7.14167, "usersrated": 84, "alternative_names": ["Campaign Commander Volume II: Coral Sea"], "stddev": 1.54228, "expands": [], "numcomments": 42}, "56242": {"mechanics": ["Storytelling"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic585043.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 5, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 56242, "yearpublished": 2006, "maxplayers": 8, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic585043_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Dft-Hung\u00e1ria"], "families": ["Nyomoz\u00f3 series"], "description": "In this game players are detectives.

The height advantage is so slight that one can scarcely appreciate it until actually upon the feature. The 26th Brigade began the difficult task of digging in while reinforcements of artillery, anti-tank guns and machine guns were quickly brought in. Rommel now gave his inevitable response; an all out counterattack to retake this vital ground using threadbare units. Over the next five days, holding this salient would prove extremely tough, with some places changing hands several times. At times the shelling on Tel el Eisa itself made it too hot for either side to occupy.\n\nThe Game\n\nEach turn is 12 hrs, with 400 yard hexes. Units are company and platoons for AFVs.\n\nAfter the Australians had nearly ruptured the Italian line on July 10, Rommel diverted many of this available troops to stop the hemorrhage as it threatened his rear area. However, the coastline ridge of hills and the Hill of Jesus (Tel el Eisa) barred their success. Once the Australians had secured their advance and held the hills, Rommel had no choice but to try to seize them back and from the 10th through 15th, this is what he did.\n\n", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Perry Moore"], "categories": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "minage": 12, "name": "Rommel's Quest For Jesus Tel el Elisa July 10-15, 1942", "playingtime": 240, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}, {"friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "name": "wargames", "value": null}], "average": 1.0, "usersrated": 1, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 0}, "56264": {"mechanics": ["Set Collection"], "median": 0.0, "image": null, "wishing": 0, "owned": 6, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 56264, "yearpublished": 2009, "maxplayers": 8, "numweights": 2, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": null, "publishers": ["(Public Domain)"], "families": ["Rummy Games", "Traditional Card Games"], "description": "Sticks is in the Rummy family of card games.

At once up to 5 sides - factions - can play.\n\nThe plot of the game is settled in the historical reality of the 17th century, Poland's heyday, the times of the gentry, covering Europe and Asia. The designers also referred to the Polish historical and contemporary prose, like Henryk Sienkiewicz (Nobel prize winner) and Jacek Komuda.\n\nIn 2009 Ku\u00c5\u00bania Gier became the publisher of the game. This new publisher reprinted the basic decks designed by Wydawnictwo Imperium and added a new starter deck of Osmanowie (the Ottoman Empire - this faction was introduced by the Casus Belli expansion in boosters). Ku\u00c5\u00bania Gier released their first own expansion in 2009 and further two in 2010. The line is constantly expanded with new products.\n\nVeto CCG has now seasons of the game (each season starts with releasing a set of sarter decks and contains next three expansions), which is connected with rotation of legal cards in the organized tournament system. So far Veto has had three full seasons: basic season (Veto 2ed, Charakternicy, Casus Belli, Ogniem i Mieczem), Warcho\u00c5\u0082y i Pijanice (eng. \"Dipsos and Troublemakers\", inlcuding Ogniem i Mieczem (partly), Do szabel, R\u00c4\u0099baj\u00c5\u0082owie, Krwi) and Szpiedzy i Dyplomaci (\"Spies and Dimplomats\", including W niewoli, Spiskowcy, Kr\u00f3lob\u00f3jstwo).

You\u2019re right! And one that you wrote! Soaps (Where Soap Opera Writers Get Their Ideas) is a card game for 2-5 players for an hour or so, where players are the managers of new soap operas during a trial period: the player whose show draws the highest audience (as determined by what events occur on their soap opera and which characters each involves) will go on to the main season!  Just like real soap operas, the twists and turns of the plots in the game can be unbelievable, outlandish, tragic or funny.\n\nThere are two main decks in the game: Events and Characters. Every Event lists what types of characters can be involved and have a point value. Every Character has a sex, a sexual orientation, a point value, and a typecast (a special rule that applies to that character). The strategy lies in developing your soap opera to allow more exciting events as the game progresses.\n\nSoaps is not a spoof on any particular show: it mocks all TV drama. No specific knowledge is required.\n\nThe game is quite simple: an 8-year-old could PLAY it, but a parent might not be pleased if the child's show were to feature adultery, homosexuality, murder, etc.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.5, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Danny Goodisman"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Humor", "Party Game"], "minage": 18, "name": "Soaps (Where Soap Opera Writers Get Their Ideas)", "playingtime": 75, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 6.5, "usersrated": 9, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 2.23607, "expands": [], "numcomments": 3}, "61359": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Role Playing", "Variable Player Powers"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic736082.jpg", "wishing": 7, "owned": 51, "expansions": [], "trading": 1, "artists": ["Randall N.

One player takes the role of the Doctor in all his regenerations, and his opponent assumes control of his arch enemy, The Master.\n\nAt his disposal, the Doctor has a roster of companions from his past to help struggle against the renegade Timelord, featuring Rose Tyler, Romana, Adric, and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, etc. His equipment includes, amongst others, his Sonic Screwdriver, K-9, jelly babies', and the Hand of Omega.\n\nThe Master has a wide selection of villainous temporal marauders to choose from: Zygons, Ood, Daleks, Sontarans, Cybermen, Robots of Death, Omega, The Valeyard, Sutekh, and The Rani, etc. He even has the meddlesome option of starting an Interstellar War - much like he did between the Draconians and the Earth Empire in Space War. His deck also features such interesting devices as the Laser Screwdriver, Tissue Compression Eliminator, and a Raston Warrior Robot.\n\nThe game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities. The Twelve Doctors is played using a 3-column time-line system, representing the battle for Gallifrey, Earth present and future, and Earth past. Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with companions EX-TER-MI-NATED! frequently, and marauders being dropped into black holes, or destroyed by the well-placed use of Venusian Aikido.\n\nNumerous tricky decisions must be made throughout. For instance, The Master has 3 planets that he can atomise during the course of each game: Telos, Metebelis III, and Skaro. This is in addition to the damage he may wreak upon Earth or Logopolis, etc, through cardplay. Destroying a planet has long-term consequences for the player, as well as short-term benefits. The Doctor, on the other hand, has the Journal of Impossible Things to use, but if he does so, makes the game easier for The Master to win.\n\nPrimarily a combat-driven card game, each player must manage his deck of cards effectively to win. In addition to simple, unique abilities, each card also has three values: power, cost, and disrupt. Both player's decks are also a measure of the time they have remaining to thwart each other.\n\nThe Twelve Doctors lineage can be traced back to San Juan, Magic: The Gathering, BattleTech CCG, and Iliad.\n\nVictory Conditions:\n\n\n     Whoever cannot draw a card has lost.\n     The Master wins if he disrupts more cards than the Doctor has left in his deck.\n     The Master wins if Gallifrey's power is reduced to zero.\n     The Master wins if Earth's power is reduced to zero (past and future).\n     The Master wins if all 11 incarnations of the Doctor are regenerated/destroyed.\n     The Master wins if 5 tokens are placed upon the Wirrn.\n     The Doctor wins if all 6 incarnations of the Master are regenerated/destroyed.\n     The Doctor wins if 5 tokens are placed upon Lucy Saxon.\n\n\n\n     Whoever gets 5 Key to Time cards in play first wins (expansion victory condition).\n\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.3333, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 5.78182, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Mark Chaplin"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Fighting", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Science Fiction"], "minage": 9, "name": "The Twelve Doctors: Doctor Who Card Game", "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": 3059}, {"friendlyname": "Thematic Rank", "name": "thematic", "value": 429}], "average": 7.82077, "usersrated": 130, "alternative_names": ["The 12 Doctors: Doctor Who Card Game", "Doctor Who Vs.

The objective of the game is to defeat the enemy mafia, led by the opponent.\n\nIn Kingpin, players choose between three different crime syndicates: the Italian Mafia, the Russian Mob, and the Yakuza. Each organization has different pieces, changing the style of each game. The Yakuza prefers quiet assassinations, the Russian Mob overcomes its opponents with sheer firepower, and the Mafia specializes in swift drive-by shootings. The game \"neo noir\" theme borrows heavily from cult gangster movies and graphic novels, such as the works of Quentin Tarantino or Frank Miller.\n\nThree important features of the game are: a two-sided game board featuring two different maps, three victory conditions available for the players, and the lack of randomness during play.

The Numberland (Zahlenland) concept has been developed continuously since the 1950\u2019s \u2013 notably by one of the designers,Dr. Gerhard Friedrich. The basic idea for this game is taken from the German bestseller \u201cKomm mit ins Zahlenland\u201d (\u201cCome with me to Numberland\u201d) by Friedrich de Galg\u00f3czy. The game can be used for as preparation for school and as a learning companion during the first school year. The following mathematical concepts and skills are addressed in gameplay:\n\nCardinal number aspect (quantity aspect): Numbers are used to indicate the number or cardinality of the elements of a set (e.g. 6\napples, 3 pine cones).\n\nOrdinal number aspect (order aspect): Numbers are used to indicate position in an ordered set (e.g. first, third etc.).\n\nArithmetic aspect: Numbers indicate the result of an arithmetic operation, e.g. an addition (e.g. 5 = 3 + 2)\n\nGeometric number aspect: Numbers are used to identify geometric shapes (e.g. pentagon, triangle).\n\nNumeric image: Numbers are represented with the aid of numeral and dice images.\n\nGameplay: Numberland consists of 10 number houses, in each of which a number lives. Numberland has to be constructed correctly. But the number goblin, Jumble, is on his way from Mistake Forest to bring disorder to Numberland. Can the players stop him and build Numberland? Luckily they have the Number Fairy to help them. The players roll a die and if they roll a Numberland symbol they can construct on one of the buildings (which are completed in numerical order). If the players roll the Number Goblin their constrcutions will be mixed up and remain so until someone roll the Number Fairy, then the mix up can be corrected. Once all houses are finished we will see if Numberland is still jumbled or correct!\n\n", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 0.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Andrea Bordihn", "Viola de Galg\u00f3czy", "Prof. Dr. Gerhard Friedrich"], "categories": ["Children's Game"], "minage": 4, "name": "Komm mit ins Zahlenland", "playingtime": 40, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}], "average": 0.0, "usersrated": 0, "alternative_names": ["Kom mee naar Getallenland"], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 1}, "57063": {"mechanics": [], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic565391.jpg", "wishing": 4, "owned": 0, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 57063, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic565391_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Unpublished)"], "families": [], "description": "Delto was the winner of the 2009 Concours International de Cr\u00e9ateurs de Jeux de Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (The Concours International)\n\nDelto is a game that allies aesthetic, elegance and the pleasure of thinking.

Nerve-wracking and intense, the battle was decided by timing, strategy and good fortune. In the span of only four minutes the war in the Pacific was changed forever. The chance convergence of the Enterprise and Yorktown Strike Groups between 10:22 and 10:26 AM on June 4th led to the devastation of the Japanese flattops and sparked the infernos which would engulf the Japanese Empire.\n\nLike its predecessor, The Hell of Stalingrad, Midway drops you right into the seat of the action. You make the strategic decisions necessary to first locate the enemy fleet and then destroy it! Scramble your fighters and organize your Strike Groups for their deadly missions. Will they destroy the enemy and make it back? Your squadrons must contend not just with the enemy's anti-aircraft fire and fight vicious engagements with the enemy's CAP, but also navigate the wide and empty expanses of the ocean. Do the survivors have enough fuel for the return trip to your fleet? Or will they too be lost forever to the misfortunes of war?\n\nThe Fires of Midway explores in separate scenarios the four major carrier battles of 1942: Coral Sea, Midway Island, Eastern Solomons, and Santa Cruz. Also included is a campaign game linking them all together in which players must husband their resources not knowing which of these battles, if any, will yield the decisive result and turn the tide of war in their favor like the historical battle of Midway did.\n\nThe Coral Sea can be played in as little as 1 hr and up to 2.5 hrs for the Midway Battle.\n\nComponents:\n\n\n     200 playing cards\n     1 sheets of counters\n     1 large deck of 18 Carrier Cards \n     3 Play Mats\n     A 16 Page color Flight Manual (Core Rules) \n     A 24 Page Operations Manual (Advanced Rules)\n     Dice (2 different colors, D-6)\n     Box\n\n\n", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 2.5714, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 5.86355, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Steven Cunliffe"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Wargame", "World War II"], "minage": 0, "name": "The Fires of Midway", "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": 2544}, {"friendlyname": "War Game Rank", "name": "wargames", "value": 327}], "average": 7.46237, "usersrated": 219, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 1.37522, "expands": [], "numcomments": 119}, "57092": {"mechanics": [], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic565722.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 5, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 57092, "yearpublished": 1972, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 1, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic565722_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Guidon Games"], "families": [], "description": "War Game Rules for Conducting Eighteenth Century Battles\n\nFrom Wikipedia\nThe rules in Grosstaktik govern weapon fire and melee. The results of weapon fire are decided by casting a six-sided die and adding modifiers to account for factors such as distance. The types of weapon fire, in increasing order of deadliness, are carbines, solid shot batteries, muskets, rifles, and grape shot batteries.\n\nWhen enemy troops encounter each other, they cannot fire and must engage in melee. Each side rolls a six-sided die, multiplies the result by the number of units in action, and then adds modifiers to account for the quality and morale of the troops. The ratio of the higher and the lower number is then computed, and this ratio determines whether the side with the lower number stands fast, retires, is routed, or surrenders. Surrendering is the best result from the point of view of the victor, and occurs when the ratio is 2.5 to 1 or higher.\n\nGrosstaktik is appropriate for re-enacting battles from the War of the League of Augsburg, the War of Spanish Succession, the War of Austrian Succession, the Seven Years' War, and the War of American Independence. The booklet includes short descriptions of each of these conflicts.\n\nNote:  Publisher not list.  Game is listed on back page along with other games from Guidon Games.

The cards are available for purchase online, or at furry conventions, such as Anthrocon and Further Confusion.\n\nIn Furoticon, you play as an Owner of your harem, pitting your Furres (characters) against theirs, where they will use their wit and sexual prowess to break through the opposing harems and bring their owners to orgasm. The last Owner to remain without climax is the winner!\n\nEach player in the game typically uses a 40-card deck, known as a Black Book. There is a shorter variant of the game where a 20-card deck is used, and each player starts with half Stamina Points (life).\n\nThe cards are meant to be traded amongst players and collectors. Decks can be customized and improved with cards that the player owns. Cards from any of the five sets can be used interchangeably.\n\nOne of the main purposes of Furoticon is to introduce players and collectors to artists that they may not have known about before. Artist credit, as well as a URL to their site, is found at the bottom of every card to encourage people to explore the artists of Furoticon.\n\nHarem members move from the Owners' Haven to the Scene, where the players can then enter Bed with their furres, and attempt to climax the other furres. Each card has a number of traits that affect gameplay, including Gender, Species, Pleasure Experience, Skills, and more. In addition to Furre cards, there are also Treats and Actions, which act as items and instant effects in the game to add a bit more depth and strategy.\n\nThere are five sets so far, each with its own theme:\n\n\n     Vanilla: Also known as \"1st Vanilla\", the Vanilla set was the original Furoticon set to be produced. With 179 playable cards, it provided the foundation upon which the rest of the game was built. There was no overall theme with this set, focusing instead on developing strategies and gender characteristics, as well as providing appealing artwork. 1st Vanilla boosters are no longer available on the Furoticon store, but the original Herm and Otherkin starters are still available for purchase.\n\n\n\n     Triskelion: Triskelion is Furoticon's premier BDSM set, focusing on masters and slaves, and bondage and pain play. Gameplay heavily focuses on adding \"pain counters\" to furres, which alter the Pleasure Experience (attack) values in either a positive or negative manner. Additionally, Alteration treats are prominant in this set, providing boosts to the Furres they're attached to, symbolizing bondage gear. Triskelion boosters are no longer available for purchase, but the two Starters (Male/Herm and Female/Otherkin) still are available on their website.\n\n\n\n     Second Vanilla: Second Vanilla focuses on college life, and showing the life and sexual adventures of such characters as Boy Toy and Lily Tyla. The set has no real gimmick, instead focusing on expanding the underlying foundation of the game. Second Vanilla boosters are running very low (as of December 8, 2013), and will soon be out of stock. There were no Second Vanilla starter decks.\n\n\n\n     Tribes of Tanglebrook: Tribes of Tanglebrook focused on a Tribal setting, with transformation and tribal markings being the prominent theme. Each Tribe in the set has a specific gameplay focus, from Wolves and their ability to intimidate furres from entering bed, to Dragons and their slow, but extremely powerful abilities. Tribes of Tanglebrook is still available in the Furoticon store, both with Boosters and with the three Starter Decks (Otters, Wolves, and Dragons).\n\n\n\n     Third Vanilla: Strawberry:  Third Vanilla: Strawberry (Or just \"Strawberry\") continues the college setting introduced in Second Vanilla. This set introduced Owners with special stats that alter the core rules of the game. The set did not introduce many new mechanics, instead focusing on developing the group play dynamic of the game further, and making the game easier for beginners to get into. Boosters for this set include 15 cards instead of the previous 10, and while there are no starter decks, there are two \"starter boxes\", which come with four \"mini-decks\", made up of 20 cards each, and designed to be used out of the box with up to 3 other players.\n\n\n\n     Di'Ahla's Awakening: Di'Ahla's Awakening is the second BDSM themed set in the Furoticon lineup. Apparently taking place before and after the events of \"Triskelion\", It serves as an addition to the gameplay elements introduced there. Pain counters and the \"Masochist\" and \"Sadist\" abilities reign dominant in this edition just as in \"Triskelion\". Overall simply an expansion to the overall theme and gameplay alterations made by \"Triskelion\". There is also a BDSM Starter Set for sale which includes both of the two-player deckboxes from the \"Di'Ahla's Awakening\" edition as well as two starter decks from the \"Triskelion\" edition.\n\n\nThere is another set planned to be released by July 2014:Fortune at Vell's End.\n\nGameplay is similar to XXXenophile.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.5, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["Animals", "Card Game", "Collectible Components", "Mature / Adult"], "minage": 18, "name": "Furoticon", "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}, {"friendlyname": "Customizable Rank", "name": "cgs", "value": null}], "average": 6.80909, "usersrated": 11, "alternative_names": ["Di'Ahla's Awakening", "Second Vanilla", "Third Vanilla: Strawberry", "Tribes of Tanglebrook", "Triskelion"], "stddev": 1.77378, "expands": [], "numcomments": 7}, "57137": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Paper-and-Pencil"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1158406.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 3, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": ["James S.

During their reign, two daughters of the House of Gonzaga married Holy Roman Emperors. In Gonzaga, players must get into the expansionist spirit of the times and build fiefdoms across Europe to stake a claim on harbors and cities, while also trying to complete secret missions. The game lasts 7-12 rounds, and players are competing in some of six regions in Europe. (The number of regions and the specific regions vary based on the number of players and the scenario tile drawn at the start of the game.)\n\nA round starts with each player drawing a fief card from their individual deck; each fief card depicts one of twelve fiefs: plastic components comprising multiple hexagonal loops with castles on some of these loops. Each player then secretly chooses both a region card and an action card, then reveals them simultaneously. Part of the fief (but not all of it) must lie in the chosen region, and the action card determines whether a player must play the fief on one or more harbors, on one or more cities, on open land, or on both harbors and cities. With this last action \u2013 the alliance card \u2013 a player can alternatively place one or two of six individual rings on the board, even on spaces that another player has already claimed with a fief. You score points for covering cities and harbors, for connecting at least three harbors in a sea, and for setting aside your fief as a donation to the church. The cards you play are set aside for the next turn, thereby forcing you to switch regions and actions as you place fiefs.\n\nThe game ends either after twelve rounds or after a trigger point based on the cities and harbors not covered. The player with the most connected fiefs, including the individual rings, scores a bonus, then players reveal their hidden objectives and score based on the number of target cities they covered.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.4691, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 6.00012, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Guglielmo Duccoli"], "categories": ["Age of Reason", "City Building", "Renaissance"], "minage": 8, "name": "Gonzaga", "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": 1947}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": 880}, {"friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "name": "familygames", "value": 512}], "average": 6.61187, "usersrated": 743, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 1.22571, "expands": [], "numcomments": 274}, "57164": {"mechanics": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Pattern Building", "Pattern Recognition"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic565624.jpg", "wishing": 8, "owned": 17, "expansions": [], "trading": 1, "artists": ["Rafael Hernandez"], "id": 57164, "yearpublished": 2008, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 1, "wanting": 3, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic565624_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Musicteachertools.com"], "families": [], "description": "From the box: \"IV-V-I is a game where harmony and music form the backdrop for composing phrases in order to score points and win.\u00a0 But watch out!\u00a0 Twists and turns await in the form of part writing errors and styles that change the game entirely.\u00a0 With its unique and intuitive method of play, anyone can jump in and join the fun - regardless of musical training!\"\n\nIn IV-V-I ('four-five-one') players take turns using the cards to create harmonic phrases, laying down up to three harmony cards and two voice leading cards per turn.\u00a0 They can also play part writing errors on their opponents to hinder their progress.\u00a0 Errors that are not corrected mean the relevant cards are not scored, and in some cases reduce a player's score!\u00a0\u00a0Composer cards allow players to break the rules to a point, but if the composer is taken out of play, what cards had been played that break the rules no longer can be counted toward a player's score. \u00a0When a player is ready to score, he locks his phrase during his turn by playing a cadence card (cadences are ends of musical phrases) and scores his progression (point values are listed on each card) up to the cadence.\u00a0 He then clears his tableau and will start a new phrase on his next turn.\u00a0\u00a0When a player has finished playing cards during a turn, he will refresh his hand and game play passes to the next player. \u00a0Players pre-determine a stopping point score-wise, with the first player attaining that score declared the winner.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Rafael Hernandez"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Card Game", "Educational", "Music"], "minage": 12, "name": "IV-V-I", "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}, {"friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "name": "abstracts", "value": null}], "average": 5.21429, "usersrated": 7, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 1.7291, "expands": [], "numcomments": 4}, "57166": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Simulation"], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic565360.jpg", "wishing": 2, "owned": 8, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 57166, "yearpublished": 2009, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 3, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic565360_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Inside Sports Games"], "families": ["Sports: Tennis"], "description": "Welcome to the world of Inside Volley Tennis (IVT) !\n\nIVT is a dice driven, point by point, yet quick playing game.

Timeline cards can also affect combat. There are two types of dice - green and red - and they vary in their effectiveness in scoring a hit. Green dice are used by herbivores and red by carnivores.\n\nPlay consists of combats between pairs of players. During combat players take the appropriate number of combat dice, which vary according to a few simple conditions, and start rolling. The aim is to score hits against the opposing dinosaur. Jurassic Wars features an interesting game mechanism where the combat dice also serve as the number of hit points that each dinosaur can sustain in combat. After a series of rolls, one player will be left with no dice to throw and his or her dinosaur is defeated. With every combat, another dinosaur is removed from play. As the game progresses some players will lose all their dinocards and be eliminated until only one player is left standing and is the winner.\n\nThe simple, probability-based game mechanism is flexible allowing for basic game parameters to be changed and also lending itself to many different variations, such as Jurassic Wars Whist, a points scoring game that involves greater skill and judgement, and Jurassic Wars Casino, a Craps-style gambling game.

The planets were built on wooden platforms an connected to the base-plate via wooden pegs. The game was handcrafted, and hand-painted, all the cards, rules, and names were invented for the occasion.\n\nThe army pieces were made from broomsticks (round pieces), and the others by sawing rectangular rods. Rocks were glued to the surface of the board and elevations were made from insulation foam. Electric illumination from toy railroads were added later, the pictures added here are from the candle - sun phase.\n\nIf players were eliminated, they received the ability to control a non-player character, who would occupy a certain space (i.e. planetary system) that could not be reached by any player, and could continue harassing the best players.\nArmy pieces were allowed to move so long as they successfully conquered a new territory, making the game travel fast, and allowing boxed-in plaers to quickly gain territory on their round. Refreshments (new armies) were doled out on two methods (agreed upon in advance). Once, with more and more armies each time, and one depending on what the player offered the non-player characters (in terms of cards).\n\nIt never left this conceptual design phase, but allowed us several years of extreme gaming fun.\n\n", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 4.0, "expansion": false, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "implementations": [], "designers": ["Frank Frischmann", "Stefan Neumann", "Lars Rose"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "minage": 14, "name": "3D Risk", "playingtime": 300, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": null}, {"friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "name": "abstracts", "value": null}], "average": 0.0, "usersrated": 0, "alternative_names": [], "stddev": 0.0, "expands": [], "numcomments": 3}, "57227": {"mechanics": [], "median": 0.0, "image": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic966193.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 3, "expansions": [], "trading": 0, "artists": [], "id": 57227, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 1, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic966193_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Marks & Spencer"], "families": [], "description": "When the game starts the action doesn't stop!

After announcing \"Ready\", the \"Holder\" may fake, pull the brick aside, or do anything to try to fool his opponent, the \"Chopper\", into committing himself. He must always return the brick to the \"Ready\" position to give the \"Chopper\" a chance to strike again. After each point is made the \"Holder\" must announce \"Ready\" before a new strike can be made. 2) The \"Chopper\" MUST KEEP HIS HAND AGAINST HIS EAR UNTIL he is READY TO CHOP. He can fake - but must always keep his hand touching the ear during the fake. Once he has started a chop, taking his hand from his ear, he must CONTINUE the chop and try to hit the brick.\nTO SCORE: The \"CHOPPER\" scores one point if he strikes the brick.

They are a small people with a population of just about 19,000 who live near the Stanley Falls not far from Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Genya were fishermen and hunters.\n\nImbelece is only played by men as it symbolizes fertility and courtship. The Genya use the seeds of the Ngola tree (Pictantus makombo) to play the game. It seems to be related to Embeli and also to some Ethiopian mancala games such as Selus.\n\nImbelece was first described by the British ethnograph P. Townshend in 1977. Later another description was published by the American L. Russ which was inaccurate (like so many of his accounts).\n\nThere was an Imbelece tournament at the Regionale Schule, Niederzissen (Germany), on May 15, 2008, which was won by David Fischbach.\n\nRules\n\nImbelece is played on a mancala board, which consists of three rows. The outer rows have six holes. The central row has four ordinary holes and a large one in the middle, which is a store. The smaller holes are called moseka (\"girls\"). A player controls the six holes in the outer row closest to him and the holes to his right of the central row. The store is used by both players.\n\nAt the beginning each girl contains three seeds called maana a moome (\"boys\") or maana a leemba (\"male teenagers\").\n\nOn his turn a player distributes the boys of one of his holes counter-clockwise into the following girls. This is called koenda (\"visiting the girls\"). After a player has dropped the last boy into the right-most girl of his outer row, he continues sowing by visiting his girl in the central row adjacent to the store, then the girl to the right, before he switches to the opponent's outer row.\n\nIf the last boy visits a girl, which contains boys, these boys including the visitor are distributed in another lap.\n\nIf the last boy makes a population of four boys in a girl of his opponent, this girl is \"closed\" by putting a leaf on it. The Genya call it kosongo moseka (\"marrying a girl\") or koija moseka (\"killing a girl\"; in other words: turning a girl into a woman). For moseka, you can also say moakali (\"newlywed woman\").
