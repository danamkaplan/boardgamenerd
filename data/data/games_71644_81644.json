Each game is a new experience since players create the game &ldquo;board&rdquo; anew each game by placing large cardstock terrain tiles on the table. Players conquer territory, recruit new units, draw magic items, gold, healers, heroes, sorcerer&rsquo;s apprentices and additions to their royal family from the Cup of Destiny to increase their power, making and breaking alliances with other players, slaying monsters and fighting desperate battles. It is possible for more than one player to win. Any game set can be played by itself or added to any of the other Fantasy Nations game sets to increase the size of the playing area and add new races, allowing larger games with more players. Each nation comes with its own special rules, terrain tiles and die cut pieces. Explore all the possibilities!<br/><br/>Each set is compatible with any of the others or can be played by itself. The Barbarian Hordes Fantasy Nations Game set includes: unique desert, forest and swamp terrain tiles, plus special rules and pieces for the Lizardmen, Orcs and Div cat-people.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Michael Brines"], "categories": ["Fantasy", "Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "5", "#text": "The Barbarian Hordes", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 120, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 1}, "73731": {"mechanics": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "usersrated": 3, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic754877.jpg", "wishing": 3, "owned": 5, "trading": 0, "id": 73731, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic754877_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Web published)"], "families": ["Aliens", "Sneaky Sci Fi"], "description": "&quot;It has been two years since the cybernetic Toracs invaded.

Initially the humans are weak- they cannot out run the Toracs and they certainly can't hope to fight them. Their only hope is to exploit the dim-witted intelligences of their converted brothers and sisters to evade total destruction. Only through surviving the Torac reactions to scavenge the ruins of their destroyed civilization can they hope to evict the invaders. They might find weapons, faster transportation, or even leftover superweapons from the 20th century in the form of nuclear devices. The best chance humanity has at removing the Torac (and winning the game) is to scavenge the ruins across the globe.<br/><br/>However, should the Torac annihilate the human presence on Earth, then their intention to convert Earth into their new homeworld will succeed unabated.

The starting player places one piece on either his/her territory, (the 13 squares in front of him/her) or on his/her opponent's territory (the 13 squares in front of the opponent). Both players then take turns placing pieces on the board. Once on the board, the pieces remain in the some place throughout the whole game. Towers are consisting of single pieces or several pieces piled on top of each other.<br/><br/><br/>THE TOWERS<br/><br/>The Towers are built with a minimum of one and a maximum of 4 pieces. Each piece in an individual Tower must have different sizes and colours. The Towers belong to the player whose territory they are built on. A player can for example choose to place a Tower on his/her opponent's territory to undermine the strength of the opponent's Towers: this Tower belongs to the opponent.<br/><br/><br/>THE CONFRONTATIONS<br/><br/>Towers confront each other when they are aligned, whether diagonally or frontally. There can be 7 frontal alignments and 6 diagonal ones. When one player has got 2 of his/her Towers on a same alignment, only the strongest one can enter a confrontation.<br/>If none of his/her opponent's Towers are aligned with his/hers, then there is no confrontation. An individual Tower can be involved in 2 different confrontations simultaneously, (one on a diagonal, the other on a frontal alignment). Both confrontations are then solved separately. In order to solve a conflict, the strengths of the Towers need to be assessed.<br/><br/><br/>HOW STRONG ARE THE TOWERS?<br/><br/>The strength of a Tower depends on the size of its highest piece. The pieces can have 5 different sizes, hence the strength of a Tower can vary from I to 5. Whatever its number of pieces, only the highest will account for the strength of a Tower. For example, a two-piece Tower can win over a four-piece Tower. There is however one exception to this rule: one-piece Towers will always lose to higher Towers. When the highest pieces of two confronting Towers are of equal strength, then the piece that comes immediately under it is assessed and so on until the confrontation is resolved.<br/><br/><br/>THE MONOLITHS (&quot;TRUMPETS&quot;)<br/><br/>Monoliths are used to visualize which of the 2 players (at any stage in the game) has got the upper hand. Each time a player wins a confrontation, he/she is given a Monolith to position on his/her side of the board, on the triangle corresponding to the alignment where the confrontation just took place.

Robert E. Lee saw an opportunity to annihilate them on the congested roads between White Oak Swamp and the small community of Glendale. Lee's army included most of the notable Confederate luminaries, such as &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson, &quot;Old Pete&quot; Longstreet, A. P. Hill and others, collectively fielding 45,000 men. The Federals, numbering about 40,000, had become disjointed as they attempted to reach and cross the James River. At the same time, though, the Confederate approach became uncoordinated and irregular. The mass of the battle eventually pivoted north of Nelson's Farm, known to the locals by its former owner's name, Frayser.<br/><br/>Frayser's Farm utilizes the all-new Musket &amp; Saber Combat System, which provides a simple yet accurate portrayal of warfare during the American Civil War. The combat system is intuitive, including all of the details that characterized battle during the Civil War while also simulating the unique aspects of 19th century warfare. Units can become weakened and rout; attackers can pursue, and the fortunes of war can intervene at any time. Cavalry can rip open enemy lines and shred fleeing units, and reserves must be ready to plug holes or secure the line of retreat.<br/><br/>In Frayser's Farm a new Combat Results Table emphasizes playability while also simulating the lethality of the rifled musket. Leaders accelerate the action, replicating the importance of their presence during battle, and supply lines require players to protect their logistical trains.

It plays across a game map that is territory-intensive in Europe and East Asia, with Africa and North America trailing along as close seconds.  The setup is abstractly accurate to the situations of the five powers (Nazi Germany, Empire of Japan, British Commonwealth, Soviet Union, and the United States) around the end of 1939 (with a few liberties taken in South America), and features neutral nations (That Japan, Germany, and Russia can attack), vassal-like allied nations (especially prevalent with Britain and Germany), capitol cities, key cities, research facilities, tanks, bombers, oil, and unique special abilities for each nation.  The objectives encourage playing across the entire map, instead of just Europe, and in fact might be more advantageous to do so.<br/><br/>Summary of National Situations:<br/><br/>1) Nazi Germany: Having taken Czechoslovakia, Austria, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, Poland, and France; and supported by its allies in Vichy France, Italy, Romania, and Hungary; the Nazi-aligned forces are poised to strike at Greece, Britain, and the Soviet Union (though the latter two are incredibly tough battles).  It has been recently brought to the attention of high command that the British-aligned forces have been building in North Africa, however, and Hitler has ordered Rommel there to advance the African front and take Libya and Egypt.  (Note: in a three-player game, one player controls both Axis powers)<br/><br/>2) Empire of Japan: Having annexed Taiwan and Korea, set up its puppet government in Manchukuo, and advanced down through Northern China, the Japanese Empire suddenly finds itself cut off from trade with the United States, a prime source of its oil.  The Japanese do have some reserve oil remaining, however, and if used sparingly, might be able to last until the Empire can secure its own sources.  There is much debate on whether Japan should declare war on America, and there is much incentive to do so, but there are some who believe that focusing on conquering China and British-dominated Southeast Asia might be a better strategy in the long run, and others still who believe the Soviet Union is an easier target. (Note: in a three-player game, one player controls both Axis powers)<br/><br/>3) The British Commonwealth: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom and its colonies have all declared war on Nazi Germany.  Commonwealth and British troops alike have poured into the battlefields of Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, as well as moved in support of British-dominated Southeast Asia and India.  The British Commonwealth also keeps a wary eye across the Pacific to the expanding Japanese Empire, hoping that their Chinese allies can hold off the insatiable Asian power long enough for the Commonwealth to get its bearings.  Sir Winston Churchill meanwhile petitions the United States to join them...<br/><br/>4) The Soviet Union: Having seen the rapid expansion and great success of Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union now seeks to expand its own borders.  The obvious choice is Finland, but Persia and Turkey to the south also seem inviting.  The success or failure of the Soviet Union rests on its ability to conquer and annex territory in much the same manner as Germany, and thus be able to display a strong showing against the remaining great powers of the world.<br/><br/>5) United States: Haunted by the spectre of the first Great War and rifled with its own domestic problems in the Great Depression, the American people want to stay out of the European War altogether, despite having become the protectors of Iceland.  President Roosevelt sees the danger of a Nazi-controlled Europe, but is having a difficult time convincing Congress of his views.  Although America could possibly get involved in the war on its own, it seems likely that the only thing that could draw the Americans is a direct attack against the United States.  However, there is a more definitive resolve to intervene if the war comes to the Americas...

Hundreds of planets have been inhabited, with the species seeing unprecedented growth and prosperity, all ruled autonomously and under the protection of the Free Alliance of Stars. Man had believed, after almost limitless exploration and colonization, that mankind was unique, and that no other intelligent life of any kind existed outside of human&minus;controlled planets. Then, the Continuum attacked the Sirius system. Human defense forces did not believe there to be a threat in the universe, and were woefully unprepared for the invasion, with nearly every man, woman, and child murdered by the alien menace.<br/><br/>Three weeks after the last message was received on Earth, the human fleet dispatched from Jupiter Base reached the Sirius system only to find that every colonized planet had been bombarded from orbit, utterly devastating the colonial surfaces. No sign was left of life, human or otherwise, until a small lifeboat was recovered in space with a dying scientist, Dr. Mark Wallace, who chronicled the assault on the colonies shortly before his death. Humans were not alone in the universe, and they were being systematically eradicated.<br/><br/>30 years later, the war was being waged in every corner of the galaxy, and Humanity had taken advantage of its genetic predisposition of reason and their inherent ability to quickly learn and adapt. They first learned the name of the enemy via decoding communications taken during battles, and later reverse&minus;engineered power sources, propulsion systems, and most importantly, the highly advanced weapons systems that the enemy had used against them. Humanity now had a hope of repelling the invaders, and would stop at nothing until the Continuum was stopped.<br/><br/>The Continuum is a collective of enslaved worlds, made up of several hundred species native to planets outside of our galaxy, all burning with the sole desire to subjugate all habitable planets and species, or destroy them if they were deemed a threat. The only chance that humanity has to stop them is to travel to the Continuum Homeworld, located somewhere in the Crab Nebula, and to destroy their leadership and command and control structure, defeating the threat forever.<br/><br/>Epic Engagements is a stand-alone tactical starship combat game that can use included components as well as models from Star Wars Miniatures: Starship Battles or any other models.

We are now considering and have some almost completed designs for enhancements to the Combat Service Support - Maintenance and Supply models.  Additionally the Fire Support - Air model could see some enhancements.  These advances in the models will bring play of the Death Ride Series to a new and exciting level.  The maintenance model for example will force some additional decision making by having recovery units go out and get the destroyed vehicles and drag them back to a maintenance unit for repair, then determining the time it will take to bring this unit back to operational condition.  This will force the players to consider the path to recover the vehicle, how close is it to the front line and if the recovery unit could be destroyed, and puts a new degree of excitement into this great game system.<br/><br/>The game features the Gross Deutschland Panzer Grenadier Division and some supporting XXXXVIII Panzer Corps units at mostly Platoon and some Company/Battery level and the Red Army (6th Tank Corps, 3rd Mechanized Corps, 67th Guards Rifle Division, 90th Guards Rifle Division, and many other supporting elements) at Company/Battery level. The combat system utilizes combat multipliers that players must use correctly to have the best effect. Each hex is 330 meters.&nbsp; Turns are 2 hours long during the day and 4 hours at night. &nbsp;<br/><br/>The rules are modeled around the seven battlefield operating systems which make them easily understood and easy to learn.&nbsp; Unlike other games at this level the rules will not be massive.&nbsp; This system features extensive use of obstacles (mines, wire, improved positions, and fortifications), a patrol rule, overwatch fire, air and artillery support, and reserve movement. &nbsp;These obstacles help channel the attack and force the Germans into kill sacks and forcing them to push through the heavy resistance to take ground.&nbsp; Overwatch is a type of fire that allows the player to move a short distance and then setup to fire suppressive fire at enemy units that might otherwise use opportunity fire.&nbsp; Reserve movement will allow a player to respond to enemy movement and move more units into a hex to strengthen it before an assault.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Units are modeled to represent the 2 major types of weapons that most units have.&nbsp; Secondary (usually small arms) and a primary (main gun, machine guns, etc...).&nbsp; These weapons may fire at different targets if they want.&nbsp; They also effect targets differently. &nbsp; Suppression is also handled uniquely in this game.&nbsp; Units that are suppressed get a defense bonus since they take better advantage of the terrain in the hex, while at the same time they have their other factors reduced.&nbsp; Units are also modeled as needing transports and get the benefits of movement from them with the vulnerability that goes with it.&nbsp;<br/><br/>The battle follows the divisions actions during the 10 days of the battle. &nbsp; The division operated with the 10th Panzer Brigade equipped with Panthers. &nbsp; The amount of armor in this game is astonishing.&nbsp; Panzer Regiment GD (110 including 15 Tiger I's), Assault Gun Battalion GD (35), 10th Panzer Brigade (200), 6th Tank Corps (180), 3rd Mechanized Corps (210), and a number of assorted assault gun units. &nbsp; Gross Deutschland has its 2 Infantry Regiments and supporting elements.&nbsp; The game will also force players to account for Command and Control and Supply. &nbsp; Maintenance and repair are critical to both sides as this determines most of the replacements that arrive every morning.&nbsp; Troop replacements are generated by returning casualties to the battle.&nbsp; Lots of these casualties are minor in nature and both sides worked hard to get these wounded back to the front quickly.&nbsp; Air-Ground Attack can have a significant effect on the battle and both sides have a capability in the air to affect the battle.&nbsp;<br/><br/>The Germans were eventually bled white and forced to suspend Citadel.

All the miniatures have values of speed and passing capabilities, and also 2-points and 3-points percentages values.

They were here when our mighty forces came, this planet that was ours by right. They fought us till they were no more, ground to dust by our stark fists of destiny. We remember though, we remember them by playing this simple game. We remember how cheaply they sold their last moments, how easily they were led to the slaughter with mere promises. We remember the last of them, the very last, for that was our promise....that the last sneak standing would find a place in our history. So now remember...&quot;<br/><br/>The Battle Of The Stark Fist on July 5th  was brutal, short and final. What remained of Humanity was marched off to a barren expanse of wreckage known as Camp Apocalypse.  As the leader of one of the last remaining factions your goal is to keep your people alive as long as you can how ever you can in hope that something or someone might come along to save you from total destruction.<br/><br/>Your first job is to secure your followers a place to survive. With limited space you plot and plan with the other faction leaders to carve out your new home.<br/><br/>Your next job is to survive each day. The one certainty is that  when the sun sets another part of Camp Apocalypse will be destroyed by the malevolent Stark Fist. In the morning will need to bargain with what resources you have, including the lives your your followers, to find out what part of the Camp is going to be destroyed. The afternoon is spent moving your followers around the Camp to avoid the coming nights destruction, hopefully with the knowledge of  where the destruction is going to happen. After the bombs fall you will need to spend the evening hours caring for those who survived. If you can not supply them with food and shelter they will perish in the harsh night.<br/><br/>Each day goes as the one before and and your goal becomes ever more important...to have your faction be the last of Humanity.<br/><br/>Game Flow<br/>-Setup Up Phase- Camp Apocalypse<br/>-Main Phase - It Was The Best Of Times It Was The Last Of Times<br/>--- 1.

Each of those days is presented as its own scenario. THD puts you in control of British Fighter Command, responding to air raids launched by the Luftwaffe, which is controlled by the game system.<br/><br/>Each one-day scenario represents up to 14 hours during which the Luftwaffe launches raids against targets in southern England, defended by the squadrons of RAF Fighter Command. German raids include bomber Gruppen (groups), attempting to hit specific targets, and fighter groups protecting those bombers and attacking British fighter squadrons. The German goal is twofold: inflict damage on targets and destroy squadrons to gain air superiority in preparation for the invasion of England.<br/><br/>The game system controls German strategy and tactics. You use your fighter squadrons to respond to the raids in an attempt to destroy or turn back the raiders and prevent their effective bombing of their targets, while minimizing your own fighter losses. Your fighter squadrons and German fighter groups may participate in several raids in a given day, while German bombers, flying from distant bases, participate in only one raid per day.

The ensuing chain of events leads to the war expanding throughout Europe. A war fought at that time would&rsquo;ve found all European militaries woefully unprepared.<br/><br/>Central to the play of the game are its &ldquo;crisis chits.&rdquo; They represent various diplomatic and military events that could bring other powers into the war. Players pick crisis chits depending on the number of crisis hexes (printed on the map) they control. The more such hexes they control, the greater the chances they have of gaining more allies. At the same time, grabbing too much territory can lead to political collapse at home, as domestic foes work to undermine your power before the conflict explodes into a wider war.<br/><br/>Rhineland Crisis War is a two-player game. One player commands the Axis, controlling Germany and the countries that choose to align with Berlin. The other is the Allied player, who controls the anti-German forces. Each hex on the map represents 62 miles (100 km) from side to opposite side. Each full game turn represents one month.

The game can be played by two to four players each using one of the colors: blue, green, red, or yellow.  What is unique about this game are the playing pieces.  Each piece is about 1/2 inch in height and pieces are of various shapes.  If you look straight down on the pieces from above, the shapes are: square, triangle, circle, diamond, and octagon.  Furthermore, the square pieces come in three sizes: small, medium, and large.  In the basic game, only three of the shapes are used.  Many advanced variations exist, including one in which all the shapes are used.<br/><br/>The game board has a series of tracks that lead from the start area to home.  Each piece must follow the track that matches its shape.  The square piece must follow the square track, the circular piece must follow the circular track and so on.  The tracks connect to each of the player's start areas to the central home area and hence intersect with each other.<br/><br/>Certain points on the tracks and intersections allow players to jump their piece over other pieces or to bump opponents pieces back along their respective tracks.<br/><br/>Finally, players can roll up to five dice (just once) to gain additional movement points.  Players must cover the numbers 1 to 6 with the five dice.  Two or more dice can be used to cover one number.  For example, on a roll of 1-2-2-3-6, the player could cover the numbers 1, 2, 5, and 6.  In this example, 3 and 4 would be left uncovered, allowing the player to move pieces an additional seven spaces.<br/><br/>The first player to move all of his pieces to home is the winner.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": [], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Dice"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "QuUMP", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 6.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "78440": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 1, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic785446.jpg", "wishing": 4, "owned": 8, "trading": 0, "id": 78440, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 0, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 2, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic785446_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Layup"], "families": ["Food / Cooking"], "description": "A game to learn how to eat with chopsticks.

The map of Europe is phenomenal in its size, detail, and accuracy. It uses a scale of 1 hex is 15 miles! There are over 4,000 counters!!! It includes land, air, and naval units. As a bonus, the game can be broken down into smaller mini campaigns, very helpful when you haven't the table area for the full map!!! I was privileged to talk in detail with John Bannerman, one of the designers.<br/><br/>This is part of the blurb from the game's web site.<br/><br/>4480 counters covering the ground, naval and air forces of (in order of &ldquo;appearance&rdquo;): Germany, Poland, Great Britain and The Commonwealth, France, the Soviet Union, Denmark, Norway, The Netherlands, Belgium and Italy.  These are supported by a meticulously researched Order of Battle for the first year of the Second World War and include additional details for the United Kingdom and Germany until June 1941.<br/><br/>17 map sections (14&rdquo; x 21&frac12;&rdquo;) for a total of 35 sq ft of maps from North Cape to Bologna and Brest to Minsk at 15 miles per hex.  Laid out, the maps occupy an area of approximately 7&rsquo; x 6&rsquo; and have been created using digital mapping software developed in-house by Diffraction Entertainment.  Maps have been painstakingly digitised from period topographical maps in the 1:250,000 to 1:300,000 range.<br/><br/>The extensive Rule Set has been devised from the start as a standard for the entire game series including a framework for an exhaustive set of Political and Economic rules defining each nation&rsquo;s operational parameters and special cases.  By the last game in the Second World War Series, these will have evolved into a detailed production model allowing players to explore different strategic options for the major combatants.<br/>Multiple modules covering Poland (Stab in the Back), Scandinavia (Operation Weser&uuml;bung), France 1940 plus The Battle of Britain (War in the West), and of course, Blitz!, a grand module to link all these together to cover the first year of the Second World War.<br/>Ground unit values are derived from OLI formulas originally devised by Trevor N Dupuy, a methodology that allows many different weapon systems to be consistently rated then summed using the ground unit&rsquo;s TO&amp;E to give a theoretical operational combat value.  Differences in national capabilities of training, leadership, communications and other &ldquo;soft&rdquo; factors are simulated using a Combat Effectiveness Value (CEV) for each nation which is then used as a multiplier to the basic unit combat value.  CEV evolves for each nation during the war showing increasing competence for Allied forces and, after initial increases due to combat experience, a decreasing capability for German forces as manpower and unit TO&amp;E&rsquo;s degrade in capability.<br/><br/>Naval units down to destroyers are shown as individual ship counters with lesser ships and submarines depicted as flotillas.  Major liners also have individual counters so as to denote their special high-speed capabilities for transporting personnel.  The naval system utilises a naval zone approximately 75 miles wide superimposed on the 15 mile hex grid so that the unique properties of naval and air-sea interaction can be modelled simply but still keep the essential flavour of naval operations with brief bursts of high intensity operations.<br/>Air Units are sized so that half units are available for carrier operations and have been rated by a bespoke system taking in to account a large number of performance parameters.  To reflect the attritional nature of air operations, air replacements are required to be expended just to keep forces in operation in addition to replacing combat losses.  Emphasis has been placed in the rules to encourage historical missions rather than wholesale commitment of airpower to offensive and defensive close air support.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 4.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["John Bannerman"], "categories": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "TSWW: Blitzkrieg", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.81818, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.683332, "numcomments": 15}, "78469": {"mechanics": ["Pick-up and Deliver"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic782726.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 1, "trading": 0, "id": 78469, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 1, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic782726_t.jpg", "publishers": ["The Game Crafter, LLC"], "families": [], "description": "Tourist Trap is a card game where you see how many vacations you can complete before you run out of money.

Then, check the &quot;conversion percentage&quot; of that team and roll a percentage dice (ie. two 10-sided dice, reading one of them as &quot;tens&quot;) for each try scored: if the roll is inside the percentage value, the try is succesfully converted (add two points to team's score); otherwise, conversion kick is failed.

Each attacking miniature is marked when it has from 1 to 6 opponents in the next squares and its movements are always diminished by the same number as the opponents that mark him. The defender can then try to steal possession. Short passes are possible within 4 squares from the ball possessor and long passes and shots at goal are performed by rolling 2 white 6-sided dice.

Eastern variants stay closer to the beginnings of the game, which featured a number of short-range sliders and leapers, but the power pieces still seem to be long-range. What if long-range pieces did not come to be so dominant? Suppose the short-range pieces of chess' infancy became more powerful by gaining additional short-range moves? Great Shatranj examines some potentials of these pieces, offering 5 different pieces that slide 1 square or jump 2 squares. Each player has up to 8 leapers on the board, giving the game a noticeably different flavor.<br/><br/>The game is played on an 8x10 board and is played with standard chess rules, except as modified by the specific piece movement rules. Great Shatranj is a short-range Capablanca [actually Carrera] Chess variant.

What if long-range pieces did not come to be so dominant? Suppose the short-range pieces of chess' infancy became more powerful by gaining additional short-range moves?

It extends the examination of short-range leapers by looking at another 2-square jumper and 2 short-range riders.<br/><br/>Grand Shatranj is a short-range variant of Christiaan Freeling's Grand Chess [name and setup used with permission and thanks] played on a 10x10 board. A Grand Chess set may be used to play. This game uses the pasha, a piece that steps 1 square or leaps 2 squares in a straight line, and introduces 2 apparently new variant chess pieces, the oliphant and lightning warmachine, bishop and rook analogs which step 1 square or leap 2 squares, then may step 1 or leap 2 again.

The game is the first game published by R&amp;D Games that has not been designed by Richard Breese.  Richard this time takes on the role of developer and the game consequently has the same look and feel as the previous Key games, with artwork again by Juliet Breese plus its own set of ani-/vegi-/arti-meeples.<br/><br/>Each player controls an extended family of workers.  Over the course of two years, players will organise their workers in an attempt to turn their initial scanty resources into a thriving economic system.<br/><br/>After an initial set up phase, the game is played over eight seasons.  Each season has three distinct phases, during which players may take a variety of actions.  The topography, weather, and seasons will influence the ability of workers to produce crops and livestock in the fields and luxuries in the villages.  In addition, resources and luxuries may be bought and sold in the market, or gold and favours sought and acquired.  Other workers may be sponsored to join the powerful guilds, where they will acquire skills as they gain promotion to become craftsmen or even the guild master.<br/><br/>Turn order throughout the game is determined by the player&rsquo;s position on the season track, which changes at the end of each season.  At the end of the game, the player who has acquired the most gold will win the game.<br/><br/>David Brain&rsquo;s designer notes on the box sides conclude by stating that &lsquo;Key Market is a reasonably intricate game.  Some of the strategies that can be employed (particularly the effective use of the market) are not immediately apparent, and some of the Guild combinations do not look so devastating at first glance.

From the thirties there was a gradual democratization in the colonies. Scandinavian countries see in the UK its natural protector against expanding Russia and Germany. After the riots in the Iberian Peninsula, Gibraltar outpost spreads to Andalusia and Portugal.<br/><br/>The Russian Empire: in the late twenties hit the Russian Empire its limits in far Asia. The Grand Duchy of Finland used the growing tension between Russia and Britain to escape from the Russia in early thirties. The abdication of a liberal the Tsar and the emergence new militant faction to power jump-started a new phase of armaments in Europe.<br/><br/>France: After the failed assassination in Sarajevo, it was France who saved by its diplomatic activity the European peace. In the thirties, France tried to create a large Mediterranean Union. South of the Apennine peninsula and Balkan were hit by neoislamic expansion of the Ottoman Empire and the French plan foiled. Against the traditional enemy - Germany - has France built an extensive Maginot Line.<br/><br/>Central Powers: Emperor Franz Ferdinand poured into crusty Austro-Hungarian veins new blood. In early twenties he federalized and modernized Austro-Hungary and in the thirties gradually agreed to trade and customs union with imperial Germany. The economic and military power of Central Powers long dampen expansionary ambitions of neighboring states. The Germans built along the lines with France its own line of defense - Siegfried Line.<br/><br/>The Ottoman Empire: the rapid modernization of the Ottoman Empire, launched by the world's thirst for oil, awoke southeast Europe to a new prosperity. Once Europe's sick man rallied by endless supply of black gold. In the late twenties, after a series of smaller conflicts, Ottomans returned to the southern Balkans and Islamic radicalization in the thirties dominate in large areas of northern Africa and even in southern Italy.<br/><br/>Each of the Powers thinks only of itself and just like you wants to be the best and win over all.

The higher the number of points from the photos, the better. The higher the number of card, the more dangerous the photographer's location depicted, so it's important to make the right decisions during the game. At the end of each round, the players determine their average score of the photos taken in their points pile using the averages table. Each round ends when the Game Over card is picked up. After the third round, each player's lowest average score of the three is selected and the player with the highest of these lowest scores is the winner.<br/><br/>Second Edition changes game as follows:<br/><br/>Players no more try to get highest average during three rounds. Instead, they try to get as much points as possible during each round and players can play any number of rounds as well. This makes averages table obsolete in second edition.

Since 1953, the Korean peninsula has remained devoid of open war, though only South Korea has prospered during that time. In contrast, North Korea has become isolated, bankrupt and confrontational. Indeed, as the North Korean economy continues to implode, and more starvation ensues, it's conceivable a desperate North Korea could resort to war to try to avoid its own final collapse.<br/><br/>DMZ utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the turns. From artillery to helicopter gunships, units can receive support to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. A single armor brigade, for example &mdash; perhaps with close air support &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy infantry corps defending an airbase. As that attack gets underway, that armor brigade may find itself under fire from rocket batteries; more support fire will be necessary to take the airbase, but assets are limited.<br/><br/>In DMZ, the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of modern warfare. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses likely to be sustained by both sides during another Korean War.

British, American and Polish airborne forces were ordered to assault and capture key bridges along the main highway leading through Holland, the Arnhem bridge being the most distant of them all. Unfortunately, the Allies had gravely underestimated the strength of German forces in the area; so, when the airborne forces landed, they found themselves scattered amid an SS panzer division. The various bridges thus became the fulcrum of the entire operation for both sides.<br/><br/>Arnhem utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the turns. From mortars to self-propelled artillery, units can receive support assets to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. A single recon battalion, for example &mdash; perhaps supported by tanks &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy paratrooper battalion defending a landing zone. As that attack gets underway, however, the recon battalion may find itself strafed by enemy fighter-bombers. More support will be necessary to take the landing zone, but assets are limited.<br/><br/>In Arnhem, the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of battles in Europe. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses sustained by both sides during the actual fighting for Arnhem.

Inside you discover a spiraling tower of RPG, video game, and movie stereotypes of every sort on each floor, and must collect treasures and artifacts  from each of them in order to challenge the Master Ghost and claim the title of Master Geek for yourself.<br/><br/>But meanwhile, a deranged, shadowy psychopathic killer stalks your strongest party member, believing that he would get your champion's powers if he kills him/her.  He's slow, but insanely powerful, and to meet him would mean almost certain doom.<br/><br/>Once someone challenges and defeats the Master Geek, the dungeon starts crumbling, but the psycho-killer still stalks you (unless you killed him before).<br/><br/><b>Goal</b><br/>The goal is to get the most prestige upon exiting the tower, getting prestige points for each treasure item collected, each artifact acquired, along with bonus points for the person who defeats the Master Geek and/or the psycho-killer.<br/><br/><b>Gameplay:</b><br/><br/>The players start outside of the tower, and walk inside to a lobby and a staircase leading upwards, where they may or may not encounter enemies.  These are all represented by cards.  The stairways/lobbies and tower corridors/rooms are represented by wider and larger cards, and each detail a special conditional effect that takes place with everyone who stays in the corridor/room/stairway/lobby, even if the conditional effect is &quot;this is just a normal room.&quot;  Some examples include rooms where battles are tougher in some way, rooms where each player's gender is changed, rooms where there's treasure lying everywhere, and a room where all the enemies are flying and thus are more difficult to fight.<br/><br/>The tower begins unexplored.  As players explore the tower, going up stairs and walking through the floors, a room/stairway/floor effect card is drawn and placed onto any unexplored space they walk into.  If a room is empty (void of monsters) upon entry, a new battle is triggered.<br/><br/>Battles are fought with a bit of luck combined with overall strength.  Each floor has a certain &quot;battle size&quot; (with certain rooms having increased battle sizes), which determine the number of monsters that can fight in any single battle.  Upon entering the previously mentioned empty room, players draw a number of encounter cards (which are smaller than the room cards) equal to the battle size of the floor/room they are on.  The encounter cards can include everything from the monsters themselves, to traps and curses that affect a character negatively, to positive boons, and any number of special training (which allows the characters to have a class analogous to the genre they are currently fighting in, or a DNA transformation that allows them to do something very similar with their &quot;race&quot; (includes standard fantasy races in floors 1-2, &quot;horror&quot; races like vampires and werewolves in floor 3, and so on...).  If a character draws the number of encounter cards required and ends up not having to fight a battle equal to the battle size of the room/floor, other players can add additional monsters to increase the battle up to the battle size.  Other players can also play cards to strengthen either side.  Multiple monsters add to each other's strengths, and special other cards allow players to add monsters beyond the maximum battle size.  Players can also negotiate another player's help if the other player is on the same floor.  Battles are fought by rolling a d12, and adding the result to each side's total strength.<br/><br/>If a monster is defeated, the player who is playing his turn may find a special floor artifact (each of which adds to a character's strength) if the monster was sufficiently powerful enough.  In order to enter the top floor, the players need a certain amount of artifacts from each floor below.  Monsters also drop loot, and players can pick up a certain amount of loot each turn.  Other players can also swerve in to raid a large loot pile.  Loot can include anything that could be considered treasure: equipment that add to character strength, free artifacts, temporary power-ups (like grenades and pixie dust), protection items, and items that are otherwise worthless but are value at high currency (totaled for points in the end).  If a player doesn't fight a battle in a room he's entered, he can draw additional encounter cards for future (or immediate) use.<br/><br/>Once a player has acquired a certain number of artifacts from each floor, he can enter the top floor, where the Master Geek resides.  Battles there are tougher than any other floor, and draw from the monsters that the players might have encountered previously on every other floor.  The players might also encounter the Master Geek himself, who's obviously a lot stronger than those tougher battles.  If a player manages to defeat him, the tower starts crumbling (one room/stairway is removed at the end of each player's turn), and the players' goal is to then escape the falling tower).<br/><br/>A twist is that there's an insanely powerful psycho-killer who's always stalking the strongest player (changing targets if that position is taken by another player).  He only moves 2 rooms per turn cycle (each player can always move 3), but if he catches you, it's very bad news.  It's very likely he'll kill the character <i>and</i> drain him of several artifacts (other monsters can kill you as well, but he's the one that'll probably have the easiest time doing it).  He's still stalking you once the tower starts crumbling, and very likely, he'll be standing between your characters and the exit.  If a player dies, they respawn at the entrance, but leave all their equipment and items as loot in the last room they were in (free for other players to raid, or to get lost in the crumbling of the tower at the end).<br/><br/>When all characters have exited the tower successfully after the defeat of the Master Geek, points are calculated, factoring in: 1) the amount of treasure/equipment a player has retained, 2) how many other players the player beat to the exit, 3) how many artifacts the player has acquired, 4) whether or not the player was the one to defeat the Master Geek, and 5) if the player defeated the Psycho.  Whoever is found to have the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["H. S.

There is a fascinating chapter devoted to Wells the Man and his journey with his &quot;Little Wars&quot; from inception to the day in 1916 when he put the game away for good. For fans of Wells' work, The Padre may surprise you with information you did not know, or could even guess.<br/><br/>Retaining many of Wells' original rules (such as the use of spring-loaded toy cannon), there are now additional rules for Shell Bursts, machine guns, observation balloons and aircraft, field hospitals, supply wagons and dumps, spies, military bands, unit Colors and Standards, Brigade up to Division Commands, hidden movement, skirmishers, snipers, unpredictable effects of terrain, signals, morale, and much more.<br/><br/>Infantry units are a standard 20 figures strong, Cavalry 12, and Artillery can appear as single Guns with crews, or as Batteries of up to three strong. From two to four such units, with a Battery, typically form a Brigade, the perfect command for each Player. Two or more Brigades form a Division, and this is the post for the Player who will act as Commanding Officer for his side.<br/><br/>Each Brigade and the Divisional HQ is represented by a variable number of Staff and ADC's, marching on foot, mounted on prancing steeds, or even seated in Rolls Royce, Cadillac, Renault, or other grand Staff Cars from the Golden Age of Motoring. From these HQ's must come the orders to the units on the firing line, but the traffic isn't all one way! Back to the Brigadiers and the Commanding General, come the reports of the scouts--and the desperate messages from the front lines delivered by Runners, Gallopers, and even Pigeons! There is far more skill than luck required to lead your miniature minions to victory, and the rules provide this without complicated systems. In many respects, there is far less abstraction in Funny Little Wars in the spaces of your garden than there is on the traditional table top.<br/><br/>While designed for yard games, the rules can be played on the floor or table top. Figures used can range from antique and modern &quot;Collectibles,&quot; to readily available plastics. Included are detailed lists for 14 different Armies identified by their &quot;Colors,&quot; (&quot;Army Red,&quot; &quot;Army Black,&quot; &quot;Army Red/Gold,&quot; etc) with complete information on how to build your favorites. Each Army has its unique strengths and weaknesses, and a personality which will definitely suggest its historical counterpart.<br/><br/>Much as Wells' rules did, FLW covers the quarter century prior to WW I, when war was still romantic, the uniforms were dashing, and the Generals still waltzed. This is the very era that gave birth to the Military Pentathalon, and a player may find himself having to excel in one or more of its challenges to deliver a crucial dispatch! Padre Paul's rules reflect the late Victorian and Edwardian spirit in both the substance of the rules and the delightful style of his writing. Designed for &quot;The Better Sort of Chap,&quot; the book contains suggestions for proper Dress during the game, etiquette on the field, and more. Nor are the Ladies and &quot;Girls of the better sort&quot; forgotten. The Padre's Wife, Georgina, provides a charming account of a &quot;proper dinner&quot; served after an especially Gentlemanly game at Dover Castle one recent Summer.<br/><br/>Not only are there the Basic Rules, but many Optional Rules allowing players to set their own levels of play. There are lists of providers of toy soldiers in every price range, as well as all manner of accessories, and recommendations on how to shop inexpensively on the Internet for those items you will not find so readily in the stores. Sections describe how to set up a yard, park, rockery, beach, or other site to be your Battlefield. For once, you WILL have room to perform that wide flanking maneuver! Light Cavalry and Infantry come into their own, screening your forces while trying to detect your enemy's. Once more, War Gaming is as much fun as when any of us discovered the hobby, no matter how many years--or decades!--ago.<br/><br/>Rules for basing figures are flexible and encourage players to work with what is best for their needs. And while comprehensive, there are no complex rules or formulae, and nothing more than traditional six-sided dice are required--besides measuring tapes and a beautiful day under the shade of the trees. Childlike, but never &quot;Childish,&quot; FLW goes back to the Hobby's roots, and even our own as we play once more with the toy soldiers so many us first had as kids.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Paul Wright"], "categories": ["Fighting", "Miniatures"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Funny Little Wars", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 1}, "76675": {"mechanics": ["Pattern Building"], "usersrated": 1, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic977704.png", "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "trading": 0, "id": 76675, "yearpublished": 2007, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic977704_t.png", "publishers": ["Beuth Verlag"], "families": [], "description": "The game is played on a A1 size board which is divided into 64 A7 fields.

Each player takes the role of a faction (or race) from the universe.  In the base game, the choices are Klingons and Federation.  Each faction has a number of ships (on Clix dials similar to the Heroclix line of components) of varying ability and with a corresponding &ldquo;size.&rdquo;  Fleets of ships are drafted to a given size total which reflects the victory points required to win.  Thus, larger fleet sizes lead to higher point (and longer games).<br/><br/>Players then &ldquo;shuffle build&rdquo; a deck of command cards.  Choosing four decks from a set of ten decks per faction.  Each deck has a unique flavor or theme, with corresponding major characters.  For instance the Klingons have a deck themed around larger ships and imperial domination and Gowron is a central character.  The four decks chosen will help to set the player&rsquo;s strategy for winning.<br/>The ships chosen have physical stats like weapons, shields, engines, and sensors. They also have mission totals for science, influence, and combat missions.  These determine the kinds and numbers of each kind of mission cards the player draws to form a mission deck.  Completing missions gains the player points, which will win them the game.   Missions could be as simple as damage an opposing ship that is larger than your own (combat), to as complex as claiming the spaces connecting your command post to your opponents (influence). Thus a player&rsquo;s chosen ships sets the types of missions they will need to earn points and the deck they build determines the way they will complete missions.<br/><br/>Points can also be earned for non-mission actions such as destroying a ship or building a starbase.<br/><br/>The game itself plays out on a randomly built board of hex cards, called sectors that start the game unexplored.  As each ship progresses through the sector, the cards are turned face up, revealing what is in that part of the sector (a Class-M planet, a Class-J Nebula, empty space, etc...). There are additionally random events that can occur when exploring, which usually correspond to a single episode of a series (for instance one encounter is &ldquo;trouble with tribbles.&rdquo; Some of these encounters also give victory points.<br/><br/>Overall, the game can best be thought of as playing out an entire season of Star Trek with the conflict between players representing the major story arc and the turns, missions, and random encounters representing individual episodes.  Players will move their ships, explore space, complete missions, play cards to upgrade their ships (and staff them with famous and not so famous crewmembers), or boost their stats in combat.  Combat, while important, is not the sole path to victory, with the mission cards being the primary factor (some of which will encourage combat).

It is a fishing game played with a Baraja, a pack of 40 Spanish playing cards. The game can also be played with the standard 52 card pack of Anglo-American playing cards, but all 10s, 9s and 8s are omitted (ace is low).<br/><br/>Cuarenta is Spanish for the number 40. This refers to the number of points that are required to win a chica (small division of the game) and also to the number of cards used to play it. Two chicas or the first chica with zapater&iacute;a (loss of the chica by scoring less than ten points) win the game (a completed game is called a &quot;mesa&quot;, which means &quot;match&quot;). The game can be played by 2 players, or 4 players split into two teams.<br/><br/>Five cards are dealt to each player, given out as a batch of five cards at a time. Each player plays one card face up onto the table. Cards on the table may be captured by the opponent. If cards are captured, they are placed face down in front of the player or his teammate. Played cards remain on the table until they are captured or the round ends.<br/><br/>Cards can be captured in the following three ways: matching (card same rank as on the table; player places matching card onto own pile), addition  (two cards add to the value of the other; a 2 and a 4 can be captured by a 6; an ace, a 2 and a 4 can be captured by a 7; cards with pictures have no value and cannot be captured this way), and sequence (a card captured by matching or addition entitles the picking of the next higher card; matching a 2 entitles the capturing of the 3 and 4 (etc.), as well, should there be any).<br/><br/>If a player clears the table by capturing all cards, they score a limpia. If a player captures the card just played by the player before, this is called a ca&iacute;da. In either case, the player scores 2 points.<br/><br/>Before the first individual turn after each deal, special announcements have to be made by each player if applicable. These are the doble ronda (four cards of the same rank) and the ronda (three cards of the same rank). A doble ronda  automatically wins the game; a ronda scores two points. After all five cards are played, there is a new deal. After all cards have been played (2 deals with 4 players, 4 deals with 2 players), each player or team counts their collected cards. If the number of collected cards is 20, 6 points are scored; an additional point is given for each captured card in excess of 20, rounded to the next even number.<br/><br/>A chica is won when a player or team reaches 40 points. The game is won when a player or a team wins two chicas or when the opponent doesn't reach ten points at the end of the first chica.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": [], "categories": ["Card Game"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Cuarenta", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 15, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 6.59, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.16138, "numcomments": 4}, "79282": {"mechanics": ["Worker Placement"], "usersrated": 502, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic799335.jpg", "wishing": 115, "owned": 670, "trading": 48, "id": 79282, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 59, "wanting": 17, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic799335_t.jpg", "publishers": ["HUCH! & friends", "Quined Games"], "families": ["Quined Master Print Edition Series"], "description": "From rules:<br/>Explore the lives and minds of Alexander Graham Bell, Karl Benz, the Wright brothers and other pioneers of invention and experience the thrill of the industrial revolution.

Battles are low luck; a character can use any number of actions to attack, with attacks always hitting. During battle, whenever an attack is made, dice rolls determine the number of damage points the character can 'spend' on hits and weapon crits. Deal enough hits, and the Zombie is defeated leaving behind a Survival token -- used to buy actions or resupply your character.<br/><br/>Like the original Assault of the Dead: Tactics adjusts the level of reaction from the Zombie side based on how well the characters are doing.

The Wonder is given to an opponent, and at the end of the game, the opponent benefits from the Wonders given to him.<br/>But that's just for the first variation of the game!<br/><br/>The titles of the Seven of games of Seven are as follows:<br/><br/><br/>     Seven Supreme<br/>     Epta (by the greek number of Seven.)<br/>     Triptych<br/>     Revenge of Mortals<br/>     Iris<br/>     Heaven vs Hell<br/>     Voidance<br/><br/><br/>Also, you might have understood by now, that all the cards in<br/>this game are related to the number Seven.

Players assume the roles of Divisional or Corps  commander. Although there are other ways to play the game, in the historical scenarios the goal is not to &quot;win&quot;, but rather to do better than the historical commanders whose role the players have overtaken. The series' scale encompasses both the Operational and Tactical  levels. Although the product is a wargame its publishers prefer to call it a simulation. It is developed by game designer Glenn Davis and published by Diffraction Entertainment, Ltd. based in Scotland, UK.<br/><br/>Foxhole's first product Utah Beach can be played by two to six players, while future installments are to allow additional players.<br/><br/>The product comes with three ways to play the game: <br/>1) The historical scenario that comes with each product where the goal is to do better than the historical results, <br/>2) A competitive (called tournament-style in the rulebook) system with over two dozen orders similar to Warhammer 40k like sieze and hold, rearguard action, etc. where your goal is to &quot;beat&quot; your opponent to the goal.  Interestingly, in this version you each take one of the hexagonally shaped maps, set up your forces, and then push them together, giving you a bit of fog of war.  <br/>3) TSWW conversion: Although seemingly not fully supported in the original product, the rulebook implies that with later releases of TO&amp;E data players will be able to play out TSWW battles at the Foxhole scale, giving gamers the first opportunity ever to play out World War II at the company scale ... everywhere.<br/><br/>As for playing the game; the following is ripped straight from the rulebook: &quot;A Primer on Foxhole&trade; in 400 Words or Less<br/>Each Player Turn consists of 6 essential Phases:<br/><br/>    Supply-Movement Phase: Units which are adjacent to enemies, plan on firing an artillery barrage or conduct an Activity this turn must Trace Supply instead of do anything this Phase.  Otherwise they may move as usual.<br/>    Barrage Phase: Barrages may be fired this Turn by Sorties and Artillery.  In the case of Artillery, they must have Traced Supply in the prior Phase and not move in the next in order to do so.  Note that the Reacting Player may also be able to fire Barrages.<br/>    Activities-Movement Phase: It is during this Phase and only if the Unit Traced Supply in the Supply-Movement Phase that Units may conduct Activities other than Movement such as digging entrenchments, demolishing them, bridges, etc., crossing a river or un-pin a Vehicle Platoon (which represents Vehicles bogged down).  Units may also move unless they fired a Barrage in the prior Phase.<br/>    Combat Phase: There are two kinds of Combat and each hex may be attacked only once.  Assaulting allows Units to enter and, if successful, secure a hex.  Its disadvantages are that it allows the opposing Player to make Covering Fire against your Assaulting Units, you have less terrain benefits and are limited to 4 Units Assaulting the Hex.  By contrast, Fights allow Units to attack enemy Units from range and has none of the above hindrances, but cannot secure a Hex and is less likely to do serious damage to the opposition.<br/>    Motorized Movement Phase: Motorized Units are all Vehicle Platoons plus any other Unit with the little wheels at the bottom.  Any of such Units can move during this Phase.  In lieu of moving, they may instead make a 50/50 attempt to Un-pin themselves from the hex (but they couldn't have moved anyway).<br/>    Vehicle Assault Phase: During this Phase Vehicles Platoons (not all Motorized Units) may make Assaults.<br/>    Full Turn: A Full Turn consists of Weather Determination and Forecasting followed by a Player Turn from each Player.  The Offensive Player always goes first, which is also the Allied Player in the Utah Beach Historical Scenario.  There are three Full Turns each Day representing the Morning, Afternoon and Night.  Preceding each Morning Turn and the beginning of the day both Players should conduct a Dawn Briefing.&quot; - Foxhole Rulebook, page 36.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The only thing the above misses is a fun little weather forecasting and resolution where players forecast the weather two turns ahead of time, and it may or may not actually end up being the weather they thought it was going to be (but *probably* will), adding a lot a pressure/tenseness as the commanders look overhead to see whether those clouds will clear up, start a drizzle, or remain overcast as predicted.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Glenn Davis"], "categories": ["World War II"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Foxhole", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 6, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "79339": {"mechanics": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic786038.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 79339, "yearpublished": 2000, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic786038_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Identity Games International B.V."], "families": ["Country: The Netherlands", "Het Grote Spel"], "description": "A trivia game with the Dutch National Ballet theme.<br/><br/>Each player gets a jurysurvey card.

This new regimental edition provides players a more in-depth look at American Civil War combat. The smaller scale allows you to take command of individual regiments and batteries and refight in greater detail many of the war's smaller engagements, as well as critical actions of the conflict's famous battles.<br/><br/>For the new player it is an easy game to learn and enjoy. The veteran Fire and Fury gamer will find much that is familiar, like the play sequence, maneuver table, and combat system, while discovering a game taken to a new level of sophistication. Refined game mechanics strike a balance between playability and historical accuracy that draw upon twenty years of the Fire and Fury gaming experience.<br/><br/>Brief Description<br/><br/>Scope. A set of wargame rules using military miniatures, that allows players to recreate the small engagements and portions of larger battles of the American Civil War, 1861-1864.<br/><br/>Scale. Tactical. 10-15 minutes per turn. 1&quot; = 25 yards. Units are regiments of infantry or cavalry and gun sections grouped into batteries for artillery. Intended for 15mm figures, other scale figures can be used by increasing or decreasing the basing and ground scales as described in the rules.<br/><br/>Basing. Each 1&quot; x 3/4&quot; stand with 3 infantry figures, and 1&quot; x 1&quot; with 2 cavalry figures, represents 40 men. Each 1&quot; x 1-1/2&quot; stand with a gun model and 2 or 3 figure crew represents a 2-gun section. Unit size can range from 3 to 20 troop stands per regiment, with the average of 8-12 stands per unit. Batteries are represented by 2 to 3 gun stands.<br/><br/>Game Turn Sequence. A game turn is divided into an alternating Union player turn and Confederate player turn. Players must follow the Player Turn Sequence. Each player turn consists of three phases. One phase must be completed before moving to the next. Some activities in a phase are performed by the opposing player or jointly by both players.<br/><br/>Maneuver Phase - In the first phase of a player turn the player must resolve a maneuver check for each unit which he controls on the game table. A maneuver check involves either one or more units under the command of a single leader, or a single unit that is out of command. The maneuver check combines the elements in warfare of morale, command and control into a single die roll procedure using the Maneuver Table. The effects from the table describe the movement and other maneuvers that each unit is allowed or required to perform in this phase.<br/><br/>Musketry and Cannonade Phase - There are two kinds of combat in the game: fire combat and charge combat. All fire combat is resolved in the second phase of the player turn. Both Union and Confederate units may fire during this phase. The phase consists of two rounds of fire combat. It begins with a round of defensive fire followed by a round of offensive fire. In the Confederate player turn only Union units may defensive fire, and only Confederate units may offensive fire. During the Union player turn the order is reversed with Confederate defensive fire followed by Union offensive fire. All fire combat is resolved using the Musketry &amp; Cannonade Table to determine casualties and other combat effects.<br/><br/>Charge Phase - In the third and final phase of a player turn a charge combat must be resolved wherever a charging unit made contact with the enemy. The relative position between attacking and defending units will determine which combats need to be divided into less complex combat situations. Both sides then follow a joint die roll procedure to resolve a round of charge combat. The Charge Table is used to determine casualties and other combat effects. Depending on the results of the first round of combat, a second round of breakthrough charge combat may follow after all first round charge combats are resolved. After all charge combat is resolved, the current player turn ends and the next player turn begins.<br/><br/>Battle Scenarios.

Proper corporation management is preferable but not the most essential.<br/>The rules attempt to simulate real conditions of business competition and relationships between shareholders.<br/><br/>THERE IS NO LUCK FACTOR.<br/>Internal balance discourages to play in a relation of 2(3) players versus 1.<br/><br/>Most of the rules are quite easy and intuitive. It is the most difficult to use the rules effectively by good planning and predicting opponents&rsquo; plans.<br/>Players manage their corporations by investing in new factories and trading produced goods to earn money (like in many other games). The point is what the players do with earned money. They can re-invest it to make their corporations earn more during next phase or try to make pressure on another player by buying shares of his/her corporation. The player who has the biggest number of shares can be elected by voting as a new leader of the corporation for the next stage. Even if you don`t have enough shares to take control over another player`s firm, the investment can be quite beneficiary because it can give you some profit (if that firm is managed well) or enforce your opponent to use the corporation money for defending, which makes his final result worse than could be achieved without your pressure.<br/><br/>Of course, the more players (max 4), the more fun there is during voting phase when all the shareholders, who are going to manage the corporation in the next stage, vote.<br/><br/>The game tries to extract maximum advantage of double circulation of money you can find in the &quot;Imperial&quot;. Players have money and corporations have money. So, what is new then? Besides the players, also the corporations can be shareholders and they all (corporations and players) vote for new leaders. It means that if you want to keep control over a corporation you had started with, you can, for instance, first take control over some weaker corporation which has some shares of yours. The best defense is attack, isn`t it? ;) The only weapon in this war is money.<br/><br/>There are some tools of defense, so taking control over experienced opponent`s corporation is rather difficult, though possible. When an experienced player plays versus a beginner, he/she shouldn`t have a problem with it. Moreover, keeping control of the corporation is useful, because it is a way of generating money for the leader, although speculating by buying and selling shares is a bit more efficient. It is the best to go both ways at the same time, choosing and changing your engagement alternately.<br/><br/>Well, it is also possible to play without any corporation and increase the value of private property only by playing as a stock market profiteer, but this way is recommended only for very experienced players.<br/><br/>There is a fixed variant of playing 2 vs. 2.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 4.0357, "bayesaverage": 5.67233, "designers": ["Andrzej Kurek"], "categories": ["Economic", "Educational", "Industry / Manufacturing", "Math", "Negotiation"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Master of Economy", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 120, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "4167"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "1265"}], "average": 6.70833, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 2.37584, "numcomments": 57}, "75445": {"mechanics": ["Card Drafting"], "usersrated": 25, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic762944.jpg", "wishing": 3, "owned": 38, "trading": 1, "id": 75445, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 3, "wanting": 1, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic762944_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Ku\u017ania Gier", "Narodowe Centrum Kultury"], "families": ["Country: Poland"], "description": "&ldquo;Grunwald &ndash; the Greatest Battle of 600 years&rdquo; - a history card game with illustrations<br/><br/>Everybody knows that on the 15th July of 1410, at Grunwald the joined armies of Poland and Lithuania defeated the Teutonic Knights Order. However, only few people will have the opportunity to&hellip; change the course of history!<br/><br/>On the occasion of the 600th Anniversary of the Battle of Grunwald, the National Centre for Culture, in order to promote the celebrations, has published a two-players' history illustrated card game  &quot;Grunwald &ndash; the Greatest Battle of 600 years&rdquo;. One of the player is the leader of the Polish-Lithuanian army and the other leads the Teutonic Order. Each of them has a separate deck of 55-cards. The fight is a dynamic 20-30 minutes game.<br/><br/>The players use the figures of military leaders, historical divisions and unconventional tactics enabling to tilt the scales of victory in one of the players' favour. The rules are simple and easy to learn even for the beginners, and the possibility of applying diverse tactics and strategies makes the game quick and dynamic, each time with a different scenario.<br/><br/>The game consists of a series of successive clashes between subsequent military leaders and their divisions. The game is won by the player who is the first to gain six banners of the enemy.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to familirise young people with history, that is why it includes educational elements such as real historical figures, battle formations and real medieval weapons. It features a description of the battle. The card illustrations were verified for their historical fidelity by a military historian, Tomasz Mleczek. The game was created by Micha\u0142 Stachyra and Maciej Zasowski from the publishing house Ku\u017ania Gier, and Piotr Foksowicz and Krzysztof Rogulski are the authors of the illustrations in the form of comic-book-like drawings.<br/><br/>In the box there are 110 cards (2 decks) together with an instruction including educational elements.<br/><br/>The game is not for sale and was distributed free of charge, among others, during &quot;The Grunwald Days&quot; on 15-17 July 2010 on the Fields of Grunwald.<br/><br/>Source - nck.pl<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.6667, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Micha\u0142 Stachyra", "Maciej Zasowski"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Fighting", "Medieval"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Grunwald: Walka 600-lecia", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 5.856, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.21065, "numcomments": 4}, "75448": {"mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Deck / Pool Building", "Hand Management"], "usersrated": 269, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1744651.jpg", "wishing": 145, "owned": 832, "trading": 16, "id": 75448, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 18, "wanting": 34, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1744651_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Arclight", "Japanime Games"], "families": ["Anime & Manga", "Tanto Cuore"], "description": "Tanto Cuore: Romantic Vacation, the second expansion for the deck-building game Tanto Cuore in addition to being a standalone game, is themed around a paradise island vacation.

The Defense may &quot;boost&quot; just ONE play per set of downs.<br/><br/>After the cards have been selected, the Offense and Defense reveal their players and the outcome of the play is determined by the ratings.<br/><br/>Run Plays: Compare the Offense Run Rating and the Defense Run Rating. The difference of the two determines the yardage. For example, if the Offense is 50 and the Defense is 41, the Run gains nine yards. If the defense uses its &quot;boost&quot; on this play and the &quot;boost&quot; rating was six, then the new Defense rating is 47 the rush gains only three yards instead.<br/><br/>Pass Plays: Add the Quarterback Pass Rating and the Pass Rating of the selected player. Take that total, and compare it to the Defense Pass Rating. The difference of the two determines the yardage. For example, if the Quarterback Pass Rating is 30 and the selected Offense Player is also 30, for a total of 60, and the Defense Pass Rating is 50, the Pass gains 10 yards. If the defense uses its &quot;boost&quot; on this play, and the &quot;boost&quot; rating was five, the pass gains five yards instead.<br/><br/>Substitutions: Teams may substitute players only at halftime. However, they can use the same starters throughout the game.<br/><br/>Overtime: If the teams are tied after four quarters, a new coin flip will determine who has the first possession of overtime. The first team to score wins the game.&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 1.5, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": [], "categories": ["Sports"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "NFL Adrenalyn XL", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 6.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 3.26599, "numcomments": 3}, "76085": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 23, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1138411.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 68, "trading": 2, "id": 76085, "yearpublished": 2014, "maxplayers": 8, "numweights": 1, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1138411_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Unknown)", "The Toy Company Argentina S.R.L."], "families": ["Admin: Miscellaneous Placeholder"], "description": "This is a placeholder for game versions that are unauthorized productions of games.

But luckily she has good friends. The mouse, the hare, the bear, the hedgehog, and the frog want to help Princess Rosie by trying to find the most beautiful fairy dress that has even been worn at a ball. Pupsi, the pig, has taken command and you can support the animals to find all the parts of the dress. But hurry up - you have to be ready before the ball starts at sunset.<br/><br/>The game board and box fit together make a diorama scene that all the players sit in front of, much like a stage. The scene is of a beautiful meadow with seven berry bushes, a castle, and blue sky beyond. The berry bushes are cards that are shuffled and placed randomly. Most of the bushes have a picture of part of Princess Lillifee's dress printed on the back so the players don't know which dress part is behind each bush. The pawns have one of the helpful animals on the back side. Pawns are placed on the board so the players cannot see which pawn is which animal. The Pig sets the goal by showing a card with a combination of a dress piece and an animal.<br/><br/>Players take turns rolling a die and moving the pawns behind each of the bushes, trying to match the animal and dress parts shown on the Pigs easel. Since the players don't know what is behind the pawns and bushes, they use the mirrored magic wand to look behind the bushes to see if they found a match. A sun mover acts as a timer as it moves from cloud to cloud showing that the ball is getting ready to start. If the players can collect all the dress parts before the sun sets, they win the game!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Kai Haferkamp"], "categories": ["Animals", "Children's Game", "Fantasy"], "name": "Princess Lillifee: The Fabulous Fairy Ball", "playingtime": 20, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 5.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.816497, "numcomments": 0}, "79795": {"mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Variable Phase Order", "Variable Player Powers"], "usersrated": 1, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic792759.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 1, "trading": 0, "id": 79795, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic792759_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Game Engineers"], "families": [], "description": "Background<br/> Zombie Masters uses the popular Zombie theme and adds some new twists to the Zombie games.<br/> This time you take the role of a Zombie Master, who creates these &quot;undead&quot; bodies and sends them out to control the world. Everybody is wondering about why Zombies are driven to eat brrraiiiins... we will give you the answer! <br/> We all know that knowledge is a drug for mankind (just ask Faust) - it's a drug for Zombies as well. Our Zombies don't want to live with a brain all the time and therefore, feed upon the Living to get there wits back. Of course, this process is very slow and it would take tons of Einstein brains to spark rational thinking in a Zombie. But who cares, if you are &quot;undead&quot; and have all the time in the world.  Additionally, if you are a very dedicated and strong human and have the (mis)fortune to get bitten and turned into a Zombie yourself, you may be lucky and retain some of your basic knowledge regarding routine tasks/skills. So a cop may be able to still fire a pistol - though much slower and maybe not very accurately or the Zombie nurse may still be able to perform the task of giving you an injection.<br/> And naturally,  - intelligent brains are much more attractive to Zombies than &bdquo;no-brainers&ldquo;.  Thus, a special resource is made available to Zombie Masters: Beer! Too much beer makes human brains unattractive for Zombies and those people who drink a lot of beer are not eaten by Zombies. And  you,  of course, as an evil Zombie Master can have the beer infested people fight or work among Zombies as well - they simply will not notice it ;-)  <br/>  <br/>General game description<br/> Zombie Masters is a game for two players, who fight for control of a city or other location. Each player represents a &bdquo;Zombie Master&ldquo;, who is able to create Zombies and control them to achieve his goals.<br/> Zombie Masters tiles are used to build a strategy for this game. Each player choose a set of 30 unit- or character tiles and put them into a chosen order in five turn sets consisting of six cards each.<br/> A game turn consists of the following actions:<br/> 1) Produce Zombie Masters resources<br/>2) Play Zombie tiles face down to locations you would like to attack<br/>3) Players alternately put Zombies or Humans on the Zombie tiles<br/>4) Turn over the tiles you like and place Zombies on them. Discard Zombies which are surplus or can't be played on the tile<br/>5) Starting with Initiative 0, use the action of that tile or attack with it until all tiles have been used<br/>6) Seize locations if there is no enemy Zombie or citizen left and at least one of your Zombies/Humans occupy the location<br/>7) Continue to feed &quot;living&quot; Zombies<br/><br/>Zombie Masters will include a base set of 30 tiles for two players as well as a whole lot of Zombies and the remote city of Riverview to battle for.

The angle and orbit of the planet had changed, and the only habitable areas remaining on Earth are between the 30th and 45th parallel. As the Earth slowly dies, burning under a closer Sol, the remaining inhabitants struggle to survive.<br/><br/>70 years have passed since the Fall, and what was once the western seaboard of the United States is the last bastion of humanity on the planet.  New settlements have grown over the ashes of the old, the largest being the Free Republic of Phoenix. Phoenix has grown and prospered, its guarded, high walls protecting it from the hazards of the open wastes. Phoenix is the center of the world now, having formed political alliances with many of the remaining settlements, providing electricity and protection in the form of its Centurions in return for manpower, goods, and food.  Ruled by an elected dictator, its laws are strong and absconders are dealt with harshly, but life in the wastes is harsher. Providing tens of thousands a stable life, Phoenix truly is the last hope for civilization, but not everyone wants civilization.<br/><br/>The Anarchists, as the Phoenicians call them, are made up of freedom loving people that will bow to no man&rsquo;s law but their own. Cut off from the much-needed electricity and fresh water produced in Phoenix, they scavenge the lands as their ancestors did, killing anyone that they encounter to survive.  In a perpetual state of conflict with Phoenix and their merciless Centurion warriors, and led by their High Priest or Mor, they will stop at nothing until Phoenix falls and the Free Cities are allowed to be truly Free.<br/><br/>Your adventure begins with the high council of your small, Northwestern village calling you, one of its strongest, bravest citizens to the village hall.  The council tells its chosen ones that the city generator has begun to fail and that you must find and recover a suitable replacement within 30 days or your people will perish and your village with fall to the wastes.

Along your way you will come upon settlements where you may barter or desperate men who may try to kill you.  The wastes are an inhospitable place for the weak, and only your strength, courage, and your choices will carry you through safely.<br/>You may undertake missions which will reap glory and rewards, may perform acts of courage that will craft your story into legend, or you may take up the cause of the Anarchists who wish to defile and rape the lands for their own benefit.

Unlike most Steam/AoS maps, Amazon does not have towns...and there&rsquo;s no way to get them on the map. Fortunately, your income isn&rsquo;t tied to links. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s tied to the &ldquo;wood market&rdquo; where each color cube represents a different kind of prized and scarce South American wood. The more wood that&rsquo;s delivered, the scarcer the supply, which drives up the price. The less wood on the board, the cheaper the wood. You&rsquo;ve got to find the rare stuff and deliver it before anyone else does. Due to the limited number of cities, the track network you build is critical.

In possibly one of the harshest climates ever to build a railroad network, you won&rsquo;t survive without lots and lots of water. However, you can only get water from the oases throughout the desert, and once they dry up, they dry up for good. If you don&rsquo;t have access to water you can pay per delivery, or if you&rsquo;re really crafty, you&rsquo;ll choose the Water Import action and not worry about water for this turn. Regardless of how you do it, it&rsquo;s going to be tough, and there&rsquo;s going to be more moisture slowing coming down your face in the form of tears than anywhere else.

One player begins as the Thing - all the other players start as human.<br/><br/>The game is primarily played out using six asymmetrical card decks - three decks for each side (each deck corresponds to a different section of the narrative). Managing your hand of cards, and when to use each deck, is key to winning the game.<br/><br/>The twelve members of the Outpost 31 team cards are positioned between the players, with each human player taking one character. The team then have to overcome various encounters, while trying to stay alive, in an effort to stop the Thing. Encounters are directly taken from film events, and are sorted into three separate acts - the second and third acts are shuffled, and then all three acts are placed together, forming one narrative (in this way, each game is a little different). Some example encounters: Autopsy of Norwegian-Thing, Battle in Dogtown, Explore Norwegian Base, Conduct Blood Test, and Investigate Crashed Saucer Site. In addition, the Outpost team must allocate men to tasks that may aid in their victory over the Thing. The truth being that the humans will not be able to achieve all that they want to do and will have to prioritise. All the while, the Thing player will do all in its power to thwart the human players, while attempting to construct its Blair-saucer in a secret ice cavern by cannibalising parts from the bulldozer, radio room, and helicopter.<br/><br/>During the game, at various stages, the Thing player has the opportunity to place infection or dummy infection cards under the human character cards. Later in the game, the Thing may even directly infect other players (unbeknownst to the remaining players), or give the impression to the others that it has! The humans must keep their wits about them if they are to fight and win against the Thing, or they may find themselves fighting each other....<br/><br/>Victory Conditions:<br/><br/>1. The Outpost #31 team win if they survive the final confrontation, having destroyed the camp and sabotaged the Thing's Blair-saucer - and have killed all the Things.<br/><br/>     If they are mistaken and some Things remain: the Things win.<br/>     If they killed a non-infected player: the Thing wins.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>2. The Thing wins if it completes construction of its Blair-saucer.<br/>3. The Thing wins if all the humans have been assimilated or killed.<br/>4. The Outpost #31 team win if the survivors manage to fly to the coast in the helicopter.<br/>5.

In a galaxy not so far away from our own, the victor of this old war has endured for centuries after the last of their adversaries were completely extinguished. After some time though, the very heart of their species began to rot with the knowledge of their forefathers and the annihilation they had wreaked upon their galaxy. In penance, the children of the last race searched the stars endlessly for some form of redemption and reprieve from their ageless guilt. And the day soon came when they found it. In the form of a small galaxy outside their own, they discovered several infant races untouched by hyperspace travel, and untouched by war. The Ancients came to our galaxy and swore they would protect its inhabitants from the same fate that befell their own. And so they introduced peace and order to the Milky Way, for only the Commonwealth could unite all the galaxy's races and prevent them from descending into the endless abyss of battle. If you remember, this is not a story about a great war. This is a story determining how the next age of our galaxy will unfold. Will you protect the Commonwealth and quell all rebellion, or will you dissent and usher in the next age of empire dominance?<br/><br/>Welcome to the Commonwealth universe where three to six players clash economically, politically, militarily, and even covertly in an epic conflict that rides upon the ground-breaking game mechanic of simultaneous turns.

The players take the appropriate Tribute Card. Each Tribute Card gives the players ratings from one (low) to eight (high) in four attributes: strength, ability, cunning, and charm. The Challenge deck is shuffled and a player is chosen to go first. The players will take their turns in clockwise order.<br/><br/>The first player reveals a number of Challenge cards equal to the number of players. Each player has three effort tokens: one (low), three (medium), and six (high). Each player, in turn, will assign one effort token face down to any Challenge card. After all the players have assigned their effort tokens, the events on the Challenge cards are resolved. One Challenge card at a time, the effort tokens are revealed and the winner of the event is determined. Each player total one&rsquo;s own Effort tokens plus the Attribute rating called for by the card, plus alliance bonuses (from Tribute cards not already in play) plus a die roll. The player with the highest total wins the event and the approval rating associated with the event.<br/><br/>Three End of Day cards were shuffled into the Event deck at the beginning of the game. When ever an End of Day card is revealed, then all the event cards are shuffled with the End of Days cards. Before the game began the players determine how many days the will last.

The original edition includes 50 of the all-time great runners and is supplemented by a 2008 Beijing Olympics edition adding 12 more runners, for a total of 62 current and all-time great runners.  Runners include all men's Olympic champions from Charley Paddock in 1920 to Usain Bolt in 2008.  Game includes factors such as fitness, injuries, false starts, weather.  Timing options enables comparison to world records.<br/><br/>Each race consists of a series of six die rolls for each runner, building on the success (or lack thereof) on each of the prior rolls.  Each runner has a separate rating for the start, 10-30 meters, 30-50 meters, 50-70 meters, 70-90 meters, and the finish, as well as injuries, form, false starts.  Approximately 30 different venues, rated for speed (fast, slow, medium), are included, as are options for a campaign game.<br/><br/>This is strictly a sports replay simulation game, with no strategy options other than runner and course selection.  Game is published by Owzat Games under license from Lambourne Games.<br/><br/>Another description:<br/><br/>At first glance the 100 Metres track event may seem an odd choice for a sports replay game. Around 10 seconds of explosive action, nothing in the way of in-race tactics (if you discount the physiological warfare that takes place as the runners line up and get to their marks, more akin to two boxers eyeballing each other before a fight than to an athletics meeting), no 'decisions' for the replay gamer to make, just pure unleashed speed from starting blocks to tape. But an athletics sprinting coach will tell you differently.<br/><br/>Each part of the race, and the training manuals usually divide the 100 Metres into four distinct sections, Start, Pick-Up, Acceleration and Maximum Speed, require varying disciplines and techniques, and world-class sprinters all have their strengths and weaknesses, so this is what we have tried to focus on in this simulation, hopefully bringing to life the running characters of some of the All-Time-Great sprinters of the last hundred years. We have extended the training manual concept of four different sections into six, taking the runners progressively to 10m, 30m, 50m, 70m, 90m and 100m and within those six Sections each athlete's ability will vary to re-create his running style. And ability too, we hope. And here we must insert a caveat. In athletics to a degree not applicable to other timed sports performances have improved dramatically as training methods, diets and track surfaces have evolved and here we are trying to compare Charles Paddock with Maurice Green, Jesse Owens with Donovan Bailey.<br/><br/>To make this simulation 'work' we have had to use a benchmark, time wise, and up-grade the performances of athletes from earlier era to this level of performance. Because we felt that users would want to be able to get close to the current World Record (in the right circumstances with the right athletes) we have geared the simulation to 2001 season performances, assuming in doing so that the great sprinters of the past would have travelled that much quicker with all the (legal) advantages that their contemporary 'rivals' enjoy today. At the end of the day, of course, it is our judgement in all such matters, you may well disagree with that, and we can only say in our defence that we have been as objective as possible after lengthy and detailed research.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Terry Goodchild"], "categories": ["Racing", "Sports"], "name": {"@sortindex": "5", "#text": "The Fastest Men on Earth", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 20, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 7.25, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.47902, "numcomments": 2}, "71851": {"mechanics": ["Partnerships", "Trick-taking"], "usersrated": 1, "image": "", "wishing": 0, "owned": 1, "trading": 0, "id": 71851, "yearpublished": 0, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "", "publishers": ["(Public Domain)"], "families": ["Traditional Card Games"], "description": "This trick-taking game is a standard deck playing card game and can be played in teams or not.

Fight melees between British regiments of Foot, coal-fired robots, fez-wearing villains, snarling, leaping mummies, knife-twirling Chinese henchman, hordes of spear-chucking Zulus, ferocious African wildlife, ravenous dinosaurs, mad scientists, vampire lords, and rifle-wielding Sikhs; or any bizarre combination that tickles your fancy.<br/><br/>DHW is set in a romantic fictional universe, half a world away and over a century ago. Most battles and skirmishes take place in the hot, mountainous country of Quarajanistan. Though bloodthirsty action has also been spied on the dinosaur-infested Namajaro Plateau, in the steaming jungles and Lost Valley of the Baka-Mang, and the deadly, secret Kingdom of the Kuji-Gani.<br/><br/>The game is based loosely on the well-known wars of British Colonialism: Northern India, the Zulu War, the Boer War, the Egyptian and Sudanese campaigns, but also includes many fantastical elements. In the world of DHW, it is not uncommon to spy an armoured airship, coal-fired borrowing contraption, Martian Tripod, steam-powered tank, or even lancers on unicycles!  During the course of play, expect to encounter heinous villains, malodorous creatures, and indecent foreigners - the likes of which can only be foiled by true-blooded Englishmen, usually followed by a stiff brandy and cigars.<br/><br/>Inspired by books and films such as The Lost World, War of the Worlds, The Mummy, Zulu, Zulu Dawn, Master of the World, At the Earth&rsquo;s Core, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, Valley of the Gwangi, and many others, DHW is a light wargame.<br/><br/>So, deterministic combat, and other such popular systems, that take away from the drama of game playing &ndash; are not part of the game before you. Also, there is a trend that as you learn more facts about a historical period, you instinctively add more detail to the game rules; the result being more detailed, complex rules systems that take longer and longer to finish on the game table. DHW is not that type of system. DHW has put to the sword: quality checks, leadership tests, and endless weaponry charts and the like. Speed of play and ease of use is at the heart of the game.<br/><br/>To enable you to concentrate on maneuvering your forces, DHW has streamlined other clunky generalship mechanisms, into an elegant and simple system: you roll movement dice for distance. By one simple roll of some dice, leadership, discipline, training, unit morale and terrain irregularities have all been addressed. This means troops move a varying distance at a time, depending upon dice rolls, rather than moving a predictable fixed distance each turn. This represents the fickle nature of warfare, as well as a large element of surprise caused by the inability of commanders, to understand what is happening beyond their immediate position on the ground.<br/><br/>With combat, DHW ups the suspense and the drama by settling any close-combat scuffles by pitting figure against figure, and opposing players roll unique icon dice to determine casualties. This contrived game mechanism is engineered to accomplish one thing - excitement. Individual combat resolution is the closest players will ever come to actually crossing sabres. Ranged fire is resolved using the very same dice - various outcomes are possible depending on which icons are rolled.<br/><br/>An often-cited shortfall of wargaming design, is that the player who rolls better dice than their opponent will always win. This is generally true, and some would say this reflects the chaos of battle and the vagaries of command. Damned Hot Work addresses this issue with Feather Tokens, gifted to each player whenever they fail certain die rolls. These tokens can be spent in multiples of four on later turns to buy instant-kills, or succeed morale checks, or move a unit more aggressively.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 3.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Mark Chaplin"], "categories": ["Fighting", "Miniatures", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Damned Hot Work: The Steampunk Miniatures Game", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 60, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "71885": {"mechanics": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "usersrated": 2, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic736766.jpg", "wishing": 4, "owned": 5, "trading": 0, "id": 71885, "yearpublished": 1981, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic736766_t.jpg", "publishers": ["National Monstergaming Society"], "families": [], "description": "(BGG description:)<br/><br/>Chandler Tedholm's Tactical Surface Combat rules replace the original War in the Pacific Surface-Surface Combat Display with what amounts to a complete tactical naval game system, explained in a mere six small-format pages of rules, and taking not much more time than the original combat system.<br/><br/>Instead of the abstract &quot;move by numbers&quot; system of WITP, the players move the actual task forces on a hexagonal hexmap corresponding to one hex on the WITP map (with simple rules on how represent terrain appearing on the WITP map), 30 hexes across.

Teams do not have all 11 players represented, they simply comprise of the star players from the following skill positions: QB, RB, WR, LB, CB, S.<br/><br/>A coin flip determines who starts out on Offense and who will initially play defense. Players share two decks of play call cards. The coach on offense takes the Offensive Play Calls and the coach on defense takes the Defensive Play Calls.<br/><br/>Coaches choose their respective play calls in secret, revealing them at the same time. The interaction between the offensive and defensive play call determines the match up of star players involved in the play. Action Cards (which form each player's hand) are used to further influence the outcome of each play.<br/><br/>The game is made up of a series of drives. Each drive is made up of a randomly determined number of &quot;Key Moments&quot; (from 1 to 5). Key Moments represent those special times during a football game that mean the difference between success and failure. For each Key Moment, a play occurs.

Each player starts out Healthy, with the Healthy side of the character card face up in front of them.<br/><br/>Each player draws three cards from the deck to form a starting hand. These cards describe various attacks (e.g. Punch, Kick, Uppercut), actions (e.g. Duck, Play Possum), or items (Firewater Bottle, Broken Chair Leg).

The goal of the game is to be the last character standing in the saloon.<br/><br/>Players take turns attacking each other as the game proceeds. A punch, for instance, will injure the target on a d6 roll of 5+, while a kick will injure the target on a roll of 4+.

Take on a hilarious hit parade of musical trivia and tasks and reach the Final Countdown before the other team beats you to it!<br/><br/>Setting Up:<br/>First, players must split up into two teams. Teams may consist of as many players as you like but must have at least two players in each. Position the game board where all players can reach it.<br/><br/>How to Play:<br/>Each space on the board corresponds to a question category (see: Categories) and states whether the opposing team asks the playing team a question or ifthe playing team chooses one of it's own members to ask their remaining team mates. Used cards are returned to the bottom of the deck.<br/><br/>Play moves in a clockwise around the board, one space at a time. For each correct answer, a team may move forward one space and answer the next question, up to a total of three spaces in one turn. A team's turn is over if they correctly answer three questions in a row, or if they answer a question incorrectly.<br/><br/>If a team fails to correctly answer a question asked by one of their own teammates, the opposing team answers correctly, they move the playing team back one space on the board. Play continues as normal.<br/><br/>If a team is stalled on a certain category and answers incorrectly three turns in a row, they automatically proceed to the next space on the board at the start of their next turn.<br/><br/>Cards:<br/>There are five types of cards that correspond to the coloured spaces on the game board.<br/><br/>Winning the Game:<br/>The first team to make to the finish space wins the game.<br/><br/>Categories:<br/><br/>Know Your Product:<br/>The opposing team reads out the four different choices of genre.

The playing team must match the artists to the facts.<br/><br/>Medley:<br/>When you land on a Medley space, you get to choose a question to answer from any category on the board.<br/><br/>Cover Versions:<br/>A player from the team draws a picture (in silence) representing the song title on the question card. The other team mates must guess the correct answer from the picture.<br/>Note: You can't include letters or numbers in your drawing!<br/><br/>Mondegreens:<br/>A player from your team reads out the misinterpreted song lyrics on the question card. The other team mates must guess the song title.<br/><br/>Word Up:<br/>A player from your team reads out the random words on the question card. The other team mates must guess the song title.<br/><br/>Musician or Serial Killer:<br/>The opposing team reads out the name from the question card. The playing team must then guess if the person is a musician or a serial killer<br/><br/>Cover or Original:<br/>The opposing team reads out a song title and artist. The playing team must decide whether that song was an original or a cover version of another artist's song.<br/><br/>Common People:<br/>The opposing team reads out the names of three musicians. The playing team must identify what the three musicians have in common.<br/><br/>Two Little Words:<br/>A player from your team looks at the name of a musician on the question card and then says two single-word clues to their team mates (the words in the musicians name are not permitted). The other team mates must guess the musician.<br/><br/>Substitue:<br/>A player fromyour team sings a song from the question card, substituting the lyrics of the song with words from a book, magazine or from the games rules.

Players compete to get to the end of the board first...<br/><br/>However, unlike a simple roll and move game, there are some interesting wrinkles. Each player uses a different mode of transport: airplane, train, truck, or boat. Each mode allows a player to avoid a hazard or gain an advantage in a particular situation that may or may not come up during any particular session. At the beginning of the game, the player who rolls highest gets to choose their mode of transport, followed by the next highest rolling player, etc. Each mode uses a different color pawn.<br/><br/>Also, players have the option of rolling for one of 5 special attributes at the beginning of the game. These attributes - 1. invoice, 2. letter of credit, 3. customs documents, 4. freight insurance, &amp; 5. the goods... are not exclusive to any one player and are randomly determined. A player may roll as many times as they like for these attributes (which can potentially prevent setbacks or lend an advantage), but once they've started moving on the board, they are not allowed to roll for any more attributes. Players must balance a desire for having as many attributes as possible with the notion of getting moving on the board.<br/><br/>The main path on the board (also the shortest path) is the Greenline of the title. However, if players land on certain squares they must roll a die to see if they are diverted onto a red circuit. This creates a delay as the player must go through a side path that usually has other negative encounter possibilities. There are also a number of yellow spaces on the board that represent random challenges which require the player to have one of the special attributes to avoid a penalty or to gain an advantage.<br/><br/>This game appears to have been developed by Philips to build teamwork or to encourage employees to think in terms of working as efficiently as possible.

Faster pace.

Never suffer through another, &quot;Draw a land. My turn is over&quot; term again.<br/><br/>2. Multi-region system. With 4 location regions per commander and a central battlefield region, you have far more options and therefore strategy is kicker. Like in a game of chess, in Conquest you need to think about positioning for your units. In most card games, it's simply your army vs. your opponent's army, 2 regions, and whether to attack or defend is a very simple matter of arithmetic.<br/><br/>3. Various strategies to pursue. Because locations and upgrades, commanders' sources of income, are vulnerable to attack and destruction, commanders have more options for how to seek a victory--a straight out offensive on the enemy domain to flat-out win or a more subtle wearing down of the opponent's income.

Let me tell ya about Jack Colty and his gang, and get ya up to gallop on all the interestin' events. Those filthy drovers and gunslingers are dangerous and desperate, each one generally havin' killed a man, and be content to live on a diet of Navy plug and whiskey.<br/>I ain't never seen no queen in her damned undies, so the feller says. But I'll tell you what - after hearin' this here stupefyin' story I'm about to unfold, well, I guess you folks can make up yer own minds why I retired early.<br/><br/>The year is 1892.<br/>The bank at Repentance Springs has been robbed.<br/>Many good citizens, including Sheriff Anton Dreyfus and school-marm Sue Daggett, were brutally slain as Colty's gang shot its way, whooping and hollering, out of town.<br/>Colonel Ned McReady and his men are tasked with bringing Jack Colty - a man so mean he'd steal a fly from a blind spider, or a coin off a dead man's eyes - and his gang to justice.<br/><br/>Revolver is a non-collectable card game set in the Old West.<br/><br/>Consisting of two balanced 62 card decks, the game pits two players against each other in a life or death struggle. One player takes the role of Colonel Ned McReady and his lawmen, and his opponent assumes control of the notorious and deadly Colty gang.<br/><br/>At their disposal, the Colty gang - the meanest bunch of low down dirty dogs in the West - have a roster of weaponry to bring down the lawmen on their tail: .38 Specials, .45 Long Colts, 1866 double barrel Derringers, and even a Gatling gun! Some example cards from the gang's deck: Cherokee Scout, &quot;Adios, Amigoes!&quot;, &quot;Thanks for yer coffee and eggs, ma'am&quot;, and &quot;Chew on this, Gringo!&quot;<br/><br/>The Colonel player's objective is to eliminate all the gang members before they can escape across the Mexican border. He can utilise such cards as Buffalo Stampede, Rattlesnake Bite, &quot;I can smell those yellow bellies on the wind&quot;, &quot;He shot my hat clean off!&quot; Apache Scout, and Rickety Bridge.<br/><br/>The game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities. Revolver is played using a 5-column system, representing consecutive gunfights in the following battlegrounds: The Bank at Repentance Springs, Whiskey Canyon, Buzzard Point, Rattlesnake Creek, and the 3:15 Express from Rattlesnake Station. Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with bandits gunned down frequently, and law-men peppered with lead by the well-placed use of &quot;Fire at will, boys.&quot;<br/><br/>Numerous tricky decisions must be made throughout. For instance, the Colty player could choose to deploy the Jackson Clan during the Whiskey Canyon battle, but the resources that this would require might make it a very risky, but rewarding, play. Similarly, the Colonel McReady player can deploy the Colonel at any time during the conflict - he's free to play aboard the 3:15 Express Train, but hugely expensive if used at Buzzard Point, for instance. Also, during the final confrontation, Jack Colty can force the train to crash - as a last ditch effort, probably killing some of his own crew in the process - he's as crazy as popcorn on a hot stove!<br/><br/>Primarily a combat-driven card game, each player must manage his deck of cards effectively to win. In addition to simple, unique abilities, each card also has two values: power and cost. Some simple icons are used to display such things as 'coming-into-play' effects, and if a gringo has 'True Grit'.<br/><br/>Revolver can trace its parentage back to San Juan, Magic: The Gathering, Battle Line, and is a new implementation of Aliens: This Time It's War.<br/><br/>Victory Conditions:<br/><br/>The Colty Gang player wins if he manages to &quot;Escape across the Mexican border.&quot;<br/>The Colty Gang player wins if he reaches and survives the battle on the 3:15 Express train.<br/>The Colonel McReady player wins if Jack Colty and all the gang members are either hanged or killed.<br/>The Colonel McReady player wins if Cortez is killed before boarding the 3:15 Express train.<br/><br/>Each bandit character card has a Survival Rating, indicating the likelihood of them surviving to the end of the game. For example, Lenny and Micky Mason have a low chance of survival, whereas Cortez has a high Survival Rating. Also, certain character's deaths have hugely detrimental effects on the game, such as having to discard a card, or in &quot;Kittens&quot; Mackenzie's case: the gang having to fight an extra two turns on the Rattlesnake Creek battlefield.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.962, "bayesaverage": 6.30002, "designers": ["Mark Chaplin"], "categories": ["American West", "Card Game", "Fighting"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Revolver", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 45, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "1164"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "206"}], "average": 6.95563, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.26778, "numcomments": 345}, "76158": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Modular Board", "Pattern Building", "Pattern Recognition", "Tile Placement"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic770175.jpg", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 76158, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic770175_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Web published)"], "families": [], "description": "DieScraper is dice-based strategy game in which players take turns in which they roll one of their set of twenty dice and then place it in the game according to simple rules:<br/><br/>- Any dice on the same level must be placed such that those dice sharing boundaries orthogonally with other dice in the same level must have their topside value differ by either one or two.<br/>- If no such move is available on the current level playing grid, a new grid starts on top of the previous grid.<br/>- Any areas of two orthogonally connected dice may serve as part of the grid of a new level.<br/>- If a new level starts and no area is playable, the game ends.

It is an historic fact that the spices trade, brought by the Caravelles, had to pay a tax of 5% in Lisbon, and this tax was used to pay for the monastery construction.<br/><br/>The goal is to achieve the highest possible number of victory points (VPs). The game ends when the last piece of Jeronimos is bought by any player.<br/><br/>The boardgame is the world map with 32 ports / destinations marked around the world (Americas, Africa, Asia and Indic Islands). In 8 of them you can collect the respective merchandise from that port. The board has also marked the real sea currents that the Caravelles followed at the time. It is surprising that often the fastest way is not the shortest, and the game reveals that perfectly.<br/><br/>Each player has a card representing 3 ships, and indicating the player's ability to travel (translated into 9 navigation discs) and the cargo capacity (translated into 6 different merchandise spaces).<br/><br/>The players place their wood ship piece in the board in Lisbon and start navigating. If they follow the sea currents marked in the board, they can do it &quot;free of charge&quot; and endlessly. But they wouldn't go very far. Every time a player wants to go in a different direction than the one indicated by the sea current, he has to use a navigation disc from his player card. When all the navigation discs are used, the player turn stops. So, in each turn, a player can go against the currents at most 9 times, thus determining how far he can go.<br/><br/>During navigation, players arrive in ports. If they are the first to get there, that is, if they are the ones that discover that local, they can place their coloured marker in that port and register the number of VPs marked for that port. If the port is a &quot;trade port&quot; (there are 8), the player can also collect the respective merchandise and place it in his player card.<br/><br/>But there are also some possible surprises. When navigate, players can pass by special marked cells which force them some kind of effect:<br/><br/>- &quot;Event&quot; cells: for each round, players have 5 &quot;Event&quot; cards in their hand; when they pass over these cells, they must choose a card from their hand. These cards can be of 3 types: &quot;Storm Card&quot;, &quot;Dead Calm Sea Cards&quot; and &quot;Good Wind Cards&quot;, thus having negative or positive effects in their navigation. But they also have an effect on other players, but for these the effect is always positive. This creates interest during players downtime. <br/>- &quot;Pirate Cells&quot;: when passing over these cells, players lose immediately 1 of their navigation discs. they can only enter the cell if they have the necessary disc available to pay.<br/>- &quot;Sinking Cells&quot;: when passing over these cells, players must take their chance with a 50/50 dice - worse can happen is they lose 1 of the 3 ships they have (or 4 - see below), and the corresponding cargo space. They will only get it back when they arrive in Lisbon.<br/><br/>After some time of navigation, of discovering new ports and collecting one each of the possible 6 merchandises that his player card can carry, the player returns to Lisbon.<br/><br/>In Lisbon the player can:<br/>- trade merchandises per VPs (5 each)<br/>- specifically, the merchandise &quot;pepper&quot; can be traded for 1 piece of the Jeronimos Monastery which worths 10 VPs, which are immediately registered<br/>- the player can also trade 15 VPs for a 4th ship - this 4th ship gives him 3 more navigation discs (increasing it's navigation autonomy from 9 to 12) and 2 more merchandise space cargo.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player receives a number of Objective Cards with specific Ports. If they are the first player to get to that port, they will receive 5 extra VPs per each at the end of the game. These VPs can be decisive in the victory decision.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.5484, "bayesaverage": 5.61024, "designers": ["Gil d'Orey"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Educational", "Nautical", "Travel"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Caravelas", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 75, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "5301"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "1419"}], "average": 5.97068, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.57255, "numcomments": 122}, "72132": {"mechanics": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Variable Player Powers"], "usersrated": 459, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic994535.jpg", "wishing": 213, "owned": 841, "trading": 89, "id": 72132, "yearpublished": 2012, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 52, "wanting": 37, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic994535_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Eagle-Gryphon Games"], "families": ["Animals: Dragons"], "description": "Dragon Rampage, a competitive fantasy game by Richard Launius, is a strategic dice game for 3 to 5 players.

Your only hope is to try to make it across unknown terrain past horrible monsters to an escape shuttle at the abandoned ecology survey station.  But if you're caught on the way, you'll end up as lunch.  So, tread carefully Space Ranger... and pray you don't taste too delicious.<br/><br/>Gameplay Abstract<br/><br/>Players take on the role of characters moving from a crash site location to an abandoned ecology station using point to point movement.  The first player to reach the ecology station is the winner.  As players move their pawns through locations, they must roll a die to avoid detection by alien monsters represented by tokens.  If detected, they must fight.  Individual players use characters with individual strengths and weaknesses and player powers, helping them avoid or defeat monsters.

Of the Zyntrac Galaxy, the four closest galactic sectors contain the most energy and power of any galactic sectors in the universe.  The very essence of this untapped power is reason inough for all Interstellar War Lords to battle for possession of them.  Players become Interstellar War Lords in Star Siege and use the forces of the Black Hole to gain strategic power over their oppenents, thus limiting their movements and eventually eliminating them from the game.  Enter the Star Siege and let yourself be cast into a galaxy where space and time do collide.<br/><br/>OBJECT OF THE GAME is to conquer the universe by strategically occupying planets in such a manner as to limit your opponent's movements and eliminate them from the game.<br/><br/>EQUIPMENT includes a game board, one die, 16 men and 144 planetary chips.<br/><br/>The Star Siege game board is separated into four galactic sectors:  Sector 1 is the closest sector to the Black Hole and contains 6 planets.  Sectors 2 and 3 are the second and third closest to the Black Hole and contain 12 planets each.  Sector 4 is the farthest from the Black Hole and contains 6 planets.<br/><br/>Each player receives 4 men of one colour and can use 1 to 4 men per game.  All players must use the same number of men.<br/><br/>Each player receives 36 planetary chips of one colour.  These are used to designate ownership of planets.  When players come to rest on a planet they place one of their planetary chips in the space provided and place their men on top.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:  Roll of die determines order of play.  First player places one of him men and planetary chips on any unoccupied planet of his choice.  Play continues in a clockwise direction with each player doing the same until all planets are occupied.  Die is now re-rolled to determine who moves first.<br/><br/>When a players man comes to rest upon an opponents unprotected planet, he invades that planet and replaces the man and chip with his own.<br/><br/>Players try to enter the Black Hole by moving up along their own planets.  Upon entering the Black Hole the player can move his man to any unprotected planet on the board.<br/><br/>A player's man can only be eliminated from the game when it is &quot;stranded&quot;.

The timeframe is the near future, between 2013 and 2021. The game has been designed by Bruce Costello using the CSR Award winning system that first appeared in Strategy &amp; Tactics no. 250. It&rsquo;s adaptable for two player, multi-player and solitaire play.<br/><br/>RDGC expands the original game into a two-mapper covering the Indian Ocean and Middle East, areas strategic to both the US and its allies and the Peoples Republic of China and its allies.<br/>In the game, Chinese forces that may be initially deployed into the Indian Ocean area are few, but they also have one solid ally at start: Myanmar. Besides Myanmar, there are other question marks for US planners. For instance, would Pakistan stand idly by if India allied with the US, given the existential threat they perceive of a US-Indian victory in a war with China? And what about Iran: if that country is ever to make a move to achieve dominance in the Persian Gulf, what better time than during a major war while its winners aren&rsquo;t yet clear? There&rsquo;s also the rest of the troubled Middle East (Egypt-Syria-Lebanon-Israel). That collective totality makes for a wonderfully varied gaming situation. Besides the main scenarios, there are numerous variants and options, adding new dimensions and giving literally hundreds of new possibilities for play.<br/><br/>Most of the ground units in RDGC represent brigades (&ldquo;brigade combat teams&rdquo; or &ldquo;BCT&rdquo; for the US). The exceptions are the Singaporean, Malaysian, Taiwanese, Philippine, and Yemeni armies. There is additionally one new corps of marines for the PRC. Aircraft are mostly represented by mixed-type combat-wings, though only one aircraft type is shown on each counter. Long-range bombers have their own mono-type units that can&rsquo;t combine operations with the other &lsquo;tactical&rsquo; air wings. Ship units mostly represent mission-oriented groups of vessels such as SAGs, subrons or individual capital ships.<br/><br/>Game turns represent varied amounts of &ldquo;real time,&rdquo; depending on the &ldquo;operation&rdquo; presently being conducted, from one to three days. An entire match encompasses the first month of the wars being examined.

The three new Dragon Generals (Onyx - black, Hemlock - green, Brimstone - red) can be used with Sapphire, the original blue Dragon, in a struggle that will severely test the mettle of the Heroes of the Realm. The new General card for Sapphire gives her an additional hit point for each other Dragon in play.<br/><br/>You can also mix and match the new Generals with the existing Generals. The new Generals minions' each have their own special abilities:<br/><br/>     Onyx's (black) Zealots go berserk when fighting - the survivors together dealing one point of damage after each combat action. You'll still take a wound from each if you remain in the same area with them at the end of your turn.<br/>     Hemlock's (green) Imps propagate quickly (whenever you place an Imp, another one pops up in every adjacent space) and steal a random card from you if you remain in the same space with them at the end of your turn.<br/>     Brimstone's (red) Fire Elementals spontaneously combust whenever three of them get together, setting the area on fire. Areas on fire require 2 Actions to move into, taint whenever three minions are present, instead of 4 and deal wounds to Heroes remaining in the area at the end of their turns.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The Generals each have their own special nastiness as well. For example, Brimstone, instead of moving along the usual red-General path, moves every time her card comes up when Darkness Spreads, flitting here and there and setting the world on fire. Players can lose cards when attacking Hemlock.<br/><br/>Any of the new dragons can also be used as an Agent of the Dark Lord when playing with at least one of the original Generals (Varkolak, Gorgut, or Balazarg). You can add up to 5 of the 10 Global Effects Cards (5 Good, 5 Bad) to the Darkness Spreads deck to adjust the toughness of your campaign. Likewise, a number of Royal Blessing Tokens (4 max) can also be added to the game. Royal Blessings allow players to either ignore a Darkness Spreads card, remove a taint crystal or prevent a General from moving.<br/><br/>For a more Campaign-style game, players can utilize the King's Champion Scoring Variant which allows players to track their feats, major and minor. Feat examples include: taking on 3 minions at once, killing two with one blow, attempting to complete a quest, successfully completing a quest, healing the land, putting out a fire, dealing wounds or the killing blow to a General... The player with the most fame at the end of the game becomes the King's Champion. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th most famous Heroes also receive titles and awards.

Valid bids are suits and no trump. No trump means that there is no trump suit and Aces are the high card for each suit. Each player bids once, with the person to the left of the dealer starting and the dealer ending the bidding round. Whoever has the highest bid starts the first hand.<br/><br/>Play starts with the starting player playing one card face up. Following players must follow suit if they can, otherwise, they can play any card they want. High card takes the trick and dictates who starts the next hand. Play continues until all cards have been played (each player will have 8 cards).<br/><br/>Each team counts the number of tricks they took during the round. The team that won the bid must have at least the number of tricks they bid to score. Otherwise, they lose the number of points bid (if they bid 4 and only took 3 tricks, they lose 4 points). It is possible to have a score in the negatives. The non-bidding team scores a point for each trick they took.<br/><br/>Teams can bid lone hands, requiring them to take all 8 tricks.

The ruler of the island, Isaac Dukas Comnenus, tried unsuccessfully to repel the Crusaders&rsquo; landing before falling back to Nicosia to regroup his forces. Once assured of the safety of his fleet, Richard set off into the interior of the island. Isaac marched against him, hoping to confront him in a vast plain favorable to the maneuvers of the redoubtable Byzantine cavalry. The clash occurred near the village of Tremithousa on May 21, 1191. The cavalry charges were horrendous and for a time the issue was in doubt, but the Anglo-Normans&rsquo; heavy knights finally prevailed. Isaac was captured, and this caused the Greeks to rout. Richard, now in control of Cyprus, could resume his journey to the Holy Land.<br/>He joined Philip Augustus at Saint Jean d&rsquo;Acre, which fell on July 12. When Philip returned to France, Richard gained sole command of the Crusader army. He marched south with the intention of liberating Jerusalem, but on September 7, 1194, Saladin attacked the Christians as they made their way down the coast. Showered with arrows, the Hospitaliers launched a premature charge, forcing Richard to give the signal for a general attack. After a violent counterattack, Saladin&rsquo;s troops were finally vanquished by one last charge of the Crusaders. Richard the Lionheart soon reconquered the coastlands, after which he negotiated an agreement with Saladin which allowed pilgrims free access to Jerusalem.<br/><br/>Tremithousa and Arsuf 1191 are the 31st and 32nd battles of the series Au fil de l&rsquo;&eacute;p&eacute;e / By the Edge of the Sword, launched in issue 26 of the magazine Vae Victis.

The game has some similarities to game Battleship, with both players having a hidden map-board and calling out coordinates to locate their opponent.<br/><br/>There are two players, German and British. The British player has the arduous task of placing the large number of Royal Navy vessels and search aircraft on his map-board before game play begins. Each map-board is on a grid, with letters on one axis, and numbers on the other. Each Royal Navy unit has a historically accurate starting point. The German setup takes but a moment, since the Germans have only a few bomber units and the task force with Bismarck and Prinz Eugen to place on their map.<br/><br/>Each turn, the players move their respective units (cardboard counters), searching for enemy units, and possibly engaging in combat. In the vast spaces of the Bering Sea and North Atlantic, the search phase becomes vital. Each player calls out grid coordinates containing a ship or aircraft, and the opponent indicates whether a ship is located there, and if so what type. A player may choose not to search with a particular unit, thus keeping its location secret (common tactic for German player, obviously). Since the Bismarck is the only enemy Battleship on the map, British discovery of her is key to victory. As the British are unlikely to have a force sufficient to sink the Bismarck when they initially find her, they will need to &quot;shadow&quot; the mighty vessel. A fast unit, such as the Heavy Cruiser Suffolk, is able to keep up with Bismarck and follow her on radar without engaging in combat.<br/><br/>Eventually, British heavy units, such as the Battlecruiser Hood may be vectored into the same square as the German Task Force. At this point combat ensues. The British also have air units on the Aircraft Carriers Victorious and Ark Royal which can both search for the Germans and attack with torpedoes from a distance. The game has combat damage sheets with squares representing areas of each warship that can be damaged in combat. As combat is resolved, squares are checked off.<br/><br/>The Germans win by avoiding contact with the British, successfully &quot;breaking out&quot; into the Atlantic and ravaging merchant shipping there. They can also achieve victory by destroying any opposition they encounter and making their way to a friendly port in occupied France. Historically, either scenario would have grave consequences for the Battle of the Atlantic. The British have a tougher task, needing to intercept and destroy the Germans. Since most British vessels are no match for Bismarck, it is necessary to vector several vessels currently on convoy escort duties in the area to form a powerful task force. Poor planning by the British or clever moves by the Germans allow Bismarck to slip through.<br/><br/>The advanced rules of the game implement a weather system, combat using a miniatures-type system (with ship counters laid out on the floor), realistic damage to ships, etc. Alternate &quot;what if&quot; scenarios and ships are provided, such as the German Aircraft Carrier Graf Zeppelin, breakout with the Tirpitz and others. U-boats are also represented (albeit in an abstract way) in the Advanced game.<br/><br/>Second edition changes included:<br/><br/>     the square grid on the original map was replaced with a  hexagonal brick grid overlay;  <br/>     the single Bismarck ship unit was replaced by multiple German ships; <br/>     the relatively simple search, movement and combat systems of the original were replaced by much more complex rules.

A variety of challenging jumps await. The exciting Perfect Stride horse game starts now! You and up to three competitors play skilled riders. Be ready for the unexpected -- sometimes lucky events occur and sometimes trouble comes your way. Collect the most ribbons to win the game!&quot;<br/><br/>The jump course, made up of up to 10 jumps or obstacles is determined by randomly placing (face down) up to 10 Jump cards in a row.  The game contains a total of 20 Jump so chances are, your course will be different every time you play.<br/><br/>In Perfect Stride, game play occurs in two phases.<br/>During the &quot;Set the Pace&quot; phase, all players secretly choose the speed at which they move their horse and simultaneously reveal that speed.  This determines the order in which the players will attempt the upcoming jump and how many Skill cards they are allowed to draw.  Skill cards will be used during the &quot;Jump&quot; phase to successfully clear the newly revealed jump ahead.  Rider Jump Order may also affect the outcome of other events which will occur.  The rider in the lead receives the Lead Rider Token and jumps first and can gain bonus points for keeping the lead BUT the faster you ride, the fewer Skill cards you draw.  The lead rider also reveals the next jump during the next game phase.<br/><br/>Players then draw their Skill cards and the Jump Phase begins.  Each rider in Rider Jump Order, makes an attempt to successfully clear the jump ahead by playing skill cards and activating special card functions.  In addition, unknown events will occur (from the Event card deck) which will affect a riders attempt.  Those that successfully clear the jump win Ribbon Points.  The order in which riders clear the jump determines how many ribbon points they win.  The Lead Rider Token may change hands many times during the Jump phase and the rider who is in the lead at the end of the Jump phase will gain bonus ribbons.<br/><br/>Perfect Stride is a game with many levels of strategy with just the right amount of luck blended in.  How fast should I ride?  Who is in the lead?  Should I sacrifice my draw to get ahead of other Riders?  Should I save specific Skill cards to use later on?  When should I take the lead from another rider?

You cannot move forward and then backward in the same move but you can move over the same square repeated as your move.<br/><br/>If you land on an enemy tank with an exact move you capture the tank.

It is played with a traditional 52-card deck.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, all players are have hands of size 5.  Each round, the players are dealt a new hand.  One player calls out a 5-card poker hand that they believe can be made by the collective cards of all the players.  The player to their left must call the previous player's bluff by saying &quot;BS&quot; or similar, or otherwise state a higher hand of their own.  Play continues clockwise until a player's bluff has been called.  Players pool their cards and see if the last name hand can be assembled from their cards.  If the hand is possible, the hand size of the player who called the bluff drops by 1.  Otherwise, the hand of the player whose bluff was called decreases by 1.<br/><br/>The next round begins with fresh hands using the new lower hand limits.  The player who called &quot;BS&quot; last round starts the new round.  If a player's hand size drops to zero, they are out of the game.  Play continues until the players only have 4 cards between them, and the player with most cards remaining is the winner.<br/><br/>Rules for hands:<br/>Pair, Two Pair, 3 of a Kind, Full House, and 4 of a Kind: must name their card values<br/>Straights, Flush, and Straight Flush: must name their high card<br/>Flush and Straight Flush: also must name their suit<br/><br/>Variant: The 2's are wild able to take any value and suit.  The 5 of a Kind hand becomes a valid poker hand, ranked higher than Royal Flush.

Decide your strategy, 1 or 2 pit stops or no one? Upon this, your tyres&rsquo; management is vital. Once the red lights turn off, insert the 1st gear and gradually speed up...you will feel like really driving! Pay attention to the curves: if you are driving too fast you could take the longer path or even go out of the track! But if you are good, you will enter the following straight at the best speed! Overtakes, accidents, tires&rsquo; wear, booster, engine damages and rain will add a touch of enchantment to all races.<br/><br/>Formula 1 IS A GAME FOR FAMILIES but SINCE no cards or dice move your car IS ALSO an interesting and appealing GAME FOR GAMERS.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY: cars are not moved by any die but according to the gear in that turn. The gear level is a pawn that can be moved on the own cars' card of one unit any turn, so the drivers can accelerate or slow down engaging a higher or lower gear every turn. <br/>The curves must be faced according to an optimal speed value shown on a sign. If the cars enter the curve with speed higher of 1 or 2 gears than the optimal one they will be forced to drive the entire curve on the outer lane or in the worst case to go out of the track and restart in the 1st gear.<br/>The cars' movement can be powered by playing the tyres cards: at the beginning of the race any driver receives 6 tyres cards (35% of value 1, 48% of value 2 and 17% of value 3). These cards increase the cars' speed (not the gear) and playing them means to have a tyres' wear: the drivers can decide for 0, 1 or 2 pit stops during the 3 laps of the race, depending how they are spending the tyres cards. Actually in the pit stop the drivers will receive other 6 new tyres cards.<br/>The booster can give a +2 movement by rolling two 6-sided dice but with the risk of damaging the highest gear compromising the race.

You must work with or against the other survivors to be the last one standing.  No not standing, cowering in the corner crying for their mommy.<br/><br/>In the spirit of AMC's &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; and &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, Eaten By Zombies takes you into a dark world of eventual death. Every turn you must venture out from your safehouse and scavenge for Swag. But not so fast, the Undead have other plans for your brains. Every day a Horde of fresh zombies will be waiting for you, and over time the threat gets greater. Now it's time for your &quot;Fight or Flight&quot; instincts to help you to survive just one more day. Using the swag you've got on you (ie cards in you hand) you must survive any way you can.<br/><br/>If you can get away or kill the Horde, you may scavenge the remains of the desolate suburbs for any Swag the neighbors may have left behind.   With the right stuff and a few good friends to out run, you may just make it through this alive... well, no probably not.  But being the last one to die a slow, painful death means you can claim sole victory!<br/><br/>With a set of over thirty different cards to start with, no two games will ever be alike. This game is a combination of Card Drafting, Hand Management and Survival Horror with a few dirty tricks thrown in.<br/><br/>Game Play/Mechanics <br/>You start with five heavy sticks (each worth +1 fight) and five hide cards (each +1 flee) as well as two sandwiches (+1 Flee &amp; Draw one card).  You shuffle these 12 cards and draw 6 into your hand.  You then face one of the 25 zombies from the Zombie Deck with a fight value ranging from 1-8 and a flee value of 1-4.  You must announce Fight or Flee and then proceed to play some/all of your 6 cards in your hand.<br/><br/>If you successfully fight/flee you then take the total fight/flee value to the scavenging portion of your turn (think of it as a &quot;buy&quot;) where you acquire items such as Shotguns, fists full of ammo, crowbar, binoculars, fire on a stick, grandma pantry, deadeye or other cards which you then put INTO YOUR HAND for use in the very next turn and draw back up to 6 cards from your draw deck.  Played cards go to your discard pile, including any zombies you have succeeded in killing.<br/><br/>If you flee then the zombie card goes to the zombie discard pile.  As you draw zombies into your hand (from shuffling your discard pile) you are stuck with them in your hand forever unless you play them into the zombie horde attacking on another player's turn, so the zombie horde gets tougher over time.<br/><br/>If you are unsuccessful in killing/fleeing then you must lose a number of cards equal to the flee value of the horde.  These lost cards come from either your hand or as a blind draw off the top of your draw pile and go back to the scavenging area, weakening you.  If you run out of cards you succumb to your wounds and become a zombie, now trying to kill the other players on each turn.<br/><br/>If a player ever ends up with six zombie cards in his/her hand the zombie players win as the remaining players have gone insane.  Each time the zombie deck is gone through and reshuffled you add one more zombie to the horde for the rest of the game, making perpetual survival impossible.<br/><br/>It isn't a matter of if you're going to die but when.  Be the last player standing and win.  If at any time the entire zombie deck is depleted (because the players have killed all of them rather than using flee), all remaining players alive win together.<br/><br/>This is a unique cooperative/competitive game where you really feel the tension and inevitability of doom.  You spend the first few turns building up your deck only to see the zombies increase in power and slowly drain your will to live as the game progresses.<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Eaten By Zombies!: In Cahoots<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.08, "bayesaverage": 5.74327, "designers": ["Max Holliday"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Horror", "Zombies"], "name": "Eaten by Zombies!", "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "3358"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "537"}], "average": 5.96127, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.6057, "numcomments": 398}, "76556": {"mechanics": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic774178.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 76556, "yearpublished": 1860, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic774178_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Standring & Co."], "families": [], "description": "This game for 2-4 players.

Players assume the role of alien species competing to abduct and control Earthlings. Cards represent Earthlings (human and otherwise). Cards in a player's hand are Earthlings that have been previously abducted, and can now be activated by their alien overlords to do nefarious tasks - most frequently abducting more Earthlings. Cards face-down at various locations on the table represent Earthlings to be abducted. The face-down stacks at each location are built up by players during the course of the game; thus each player potentially has some knowledge about what types of Earthlings are at each location, which is where memory becomes involved.<br/><br/>Players move their spaceship tokens from location to location, abducting Earthlings (moving some of the face-down cards away from the location), and then fly back to their homeworlds to score them. Some Earthlings cause trouble when they are abducted (damaging the spaceship), while other may offer benefits while they are aboard. Players can also directly and indirectly attack other players' spaceships, to either prevent them from completing their abduction goals or sometimes to steal dangerous Earthlings without suffering the consequences.<br/><br/>Players win by successfully abducting 10 Earthlings and returning them to their homeworld. Each player also has a secret objective which allows them to win with a smaller number of Earthlings, such as six of the same species or 7 of the same gender.<br/><br/>Earthling Abductor: Deluxe Edition contains 68 Earthling cards, 7 Alien races, and 6 plastic space-ships.

In Trollhalla, you join forces with your fellow trolls to sail the seas in search of islands filled with pillage and plunder. Crunchy livestock, nervous monks, panicked princesses, piles of gold, and casks of grog await you! But watch out for Billy Goats--if you&rsquo;re not careful they will knock parts of your precious stolen cargo out of your boat!<br/><br/>With so many goodies lying about on these islands, it feels like you&rsquo;ve died and gone to troll heaven, or perhaps someplace even better -- Trollhalla!<br/><br/>Object<br/>Players take turns placing trolls on the board. Trolls emerge from below each ship&rsquo;s deck ready to plunder and scout the seas of Trollhalla! Trolls placed on ships claim plunder from nearby islands when a ship sails. Trolls placed in the sea will scout for destinations and determine where these ships sail, and also award players cards that perform special actions.

After the first turn, they alternate having first choice of where to place. Tiles must touch any edge of at least one tile that is already played, or of a location the opponent has currently chosen.<br/><br/>Hiding the front side from the opponent to conceal the tile's rotation, they position their tiles upright with its edge on the table. Simultaneously, when their tiles are both touching the table, they tip their tiles toward each other so the tiles are laying down on the table. Repeat.<br/><br/>Players attempt to form three target shapes with their own color and the opponent's color.<br/><br/>Look for a Black rock which crushes a White scissors, for instance. The game would immediately end in a victory for Black-- unless a White paper is formed at the exact same time, and covers the Black rock. That's one point for White and one point for Black. In that case, the game continues until one player has at least one more winning shape combination on the board than the other. If the score is still tied when the last tiles are played, the game is a draw.<br/><br/>It is possible for two tiles to be part of multiple shapes. For example, a White scissors and White paper can share two tiles and still qualify as two complete shapes.<br/><br/>Strategy Basics:<br/><br/><br/>     Pay attention to what structures your opponent is building, and disrupt them if necessary.<br/>     Remember, with every tile, you are placing your own color and your opponent's color.<br/>     &quot;Telegraph punches that you're not throwing.&quot; Get your opponent to believe you're building toward a particular victory, and suddenly switch to build a different one.<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Matt Arnold"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Print & Play"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Antigrams", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 5, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "76595": {"mechanics": ["Area Movement", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "usersrated": 0, "image": "", "wishing": 0, "owned": 0, "trading": 0, "id": 76595, "yearpublished": 2001, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "", "publishers": ["(Web published)"], "families": ["Animals: Turtles", "Looney Pyramids"], "description": "This is an Icehouse board game in the style of the Frogger video game.

Simplified deck building, hand management, simultaneous hidden worker placement, a card draft, 6 unique player advantages, and a revolutionary zero-luck combat resolution system ensure that playing Exile Sun is like no other game. Private and public card-based objectives give players options for points, but they must choose carefully when allocating their limited resources. The player with the most points accumulated at the end of three game cycles wins.<br/><br/>A Game Round<br/><br/>The game simply consists of cycles where each player in turn makes four fleet moves and then ends their turn by moving a pawn on the 'Timer Track'. The 'Timer Track' triggers events like 'Supply' and 'Battle' that effect all players simultaneously. Once each event is resolved, the player turns continue.<br/><br/><br/>            Moves - These moves can be regular movement, scanning an enemy fleet, launching a decoy fleet, and initiating a battle.  <br/>            Events - The battle and supply events are resolved with a mechanic that may be best described as simultaneous hidden worker placement. This unique mechanic involves the use of a control card with 10 sliding tabs. The resulting game play is tense, intuitive, and intensely competitive. <br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>Theme Overview<br/><br/>Far off and forgotten, orbiting the Exile star, a fragmented group of Colonial powers is struggling to exist in the harsh environment of their foreign home.  Having been unexpectedly cut off from contact with Earth over two hundred years ago, the process of gaining some economic recovery has been slow and arduous.  With dissension rising among the populace, these leaders must compete to gain military, economic, and technological advantages over each other in a race to lead the united colonies in a mission to contact Earth. Time is short. While an outright planetary assault could express dominance in military power, perhaps luring out and destroying an opposing Flagship or Construction Shipyard can have the same effect using fewer resources. Or hit and run assaults with fleets of strike craft can be equally effective. But be warned, leaders dare not neglect their own colony resources, or their supporters will lose faith in them and they&rsquo;ll fall quickly out of the race.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 3.0, "bayesaverage": 5.50099, "designers": ["Eric A.

The Michigan Rummy board consists of nine sections.  WINNING PAY CARDS are indicated next to each section on the board.  The round center section is the Michigan Rummy Pot.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY:<br/>(1) THE DEAL.  The deal is determined by cutting the cards, high card winning the deal.  Players then place one chip in each of the3 nine sections of the plastic tray, except the dealer who places two chips in each section.  The dealer shuffles the cards and deals all of them out, one card at a time to each player, to the left.  One extra, or dummy hand, is dealt in front of the dealer.  It does not matter if some players receive one more card than others.<br/><br/>(2) THE PLAY.<br/>(a) The dealer picks up either one of the two hands before him.  The dealer may, after looking at his hand, have the option of exchanging his hand for the dummy hand (but without looking at the dummy hand) or selling the dummy hand to the player making the highest bid for it.  Any player (including dealer) cannot exchange his hand for the dummy hand if he holds a PAY CARD.  The exchange of hands must be made complete.  Player cannot retain any of the cards in his original hand.  The amount of chips bid for the dummy hand go to the dealer and the player making the bid then exchanges his own hand for the dummy hand.  The extra hand is then put aside.<br/><br/>(b) POKER. Before beginning the actual play of MICHIGAN RUMMY a hand of poker is played for the chips in the poker pool section.  Each player forms their best poker hand with five cards from his hand.  The remainder of their hands are kept face down in front of them for later use. The dealer starts the betting and can bet, or pass, the other players doing likewise.  The bets and raises are placed in the poker pool section, and the winning hand receives all these chips.<br/><br/>(c) MICHIGAN RUMMY. The players take up all their cards and the dealer starts by playing the lowest card of any suit in his hand he wishes (Ace is high, duece is low).  He MUST play the lowest card of the suit he chooses.  He calls out the card and places it in front of him.  The player who holds the next higher consecutive card in the same suit plays it, placing it in front of him and calling out its name, etc., and this continues until the Ace of the suit is played, or a STOP is reached (due to the dummy hand holding the next high card).  The player who played an ACE or STOP card reopens with the lowest card in his hand in ANOTHER suit and play continues accordingly.  If a player cannot reopen with a card of another suit after a STOP, play ends there and there is no payment for the deal.  Any player who plays a PAY CARD takes all the chips from the corresponding section of the playing board (i.e. if you play the King of Clubs you collect all the chips in the King of Clubs section).  In order to collect for some PAY CARDS, they must be played in sequence by the same player (i.e. Queen of Hearts, King of Hearts, and 7, 8, and 9 of any suit).  The first player to discard all his cards wins all the chips in the Michigan Rummy Pot (round center section).  A variation may be played by having the winner collect one chip from each of the other players for every card remaining in that player's hand, in addition to the Michigan Rummy Pot.  The game is then over and the deal goes to the left for the next game.<br/><br/>The players again place a chip in each of the nine sections (the dealer placing two chips in each section) even though some chips may still remain from previous play.<br/><br/>After the final game of play, it may be found that chips remain in several sections of the playing board.  If this is the case, all of these chips may be placed in the POKER POOL section and a &quot;showdown&quot; hand of poker may be played.  Five cards are dealt face up to each player and the player with the best POKER HAND wins all the remaining chips on the board.  If players are not familiar with hand values in poker, below is listed, in order, winning combinations:<br/>(1) Straight Flush (3-4-5-6-7) or any other sequence of five cards all one suit.<br/>(2) Four of a kind.<br/>(3) Full house (three of a kind and one pair).<br/>(4) Flush--all one suit, but not in sequence.<br/>(5) Straight--(3-4-5-6-7) or any other sequence of different suits.<br/>(6) Three of a kind.<br/>(7) Two pairs.<br/>(8) One pair.<br/><br/>Also see:<br/><br/>    Tripoley<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.5, "bayesaverage": 5.51147, "designers": [], "categories": ["Card Game"], "name": "Hoyle Rummy", "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "10064"}], "average": 5.72239, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.75739, "numcomments": 15}, "80836": {"mechanics": ["Simultaneous Action Selection"], "usersrated": 85, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic843356.jpg", "wishing": 20, "owned": 169, "trading": 15, "id": 80836, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 12, "numweights": 7, "wanting": 4, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic843356_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Closet Nerd Games", "Sandstorm Productions LLC"], "families": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!"], "description": "In the Target, you are either a CIA or KGB agent trying to deposit sensitive intel to your agency's headquarters.

It is played with a standard deck of cards,along with six new types: Super Fives, Zero Card, Super Ace, Wild, Super Card, and the Master Card. In addition it uses a cribbage board which is a signature piece of equipment with holes and pegs for scoring.<br/><br/>Players are each dealt a hand of 6 cards, of which they discard 2 into a special pile called the Crib. One card is then cut from draw pile and turned face up - it is considered part of each player's hand and of the Crib. The players then alternately play a card, scoring points for hitting certain totals, or for making sets or sequences. Score is kept by moving pegs around tracks on the cribbage board. This is repeated until all players have exhausted their hand of cards. Once all players are out of cards, each player picks up his hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board. The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points. Then the cards are shuffled, the deal alternates, and the process is repeated.<br/><br/>2-players and teams of two play a full length game to 181 points. 3 individuals end play until 141 points. 4 individual players play to a standard cribbage length game of 121 points.<br/><br/>The six special cards are the crux of the game.<br/><br/>The Zero Card: When someone plays a card for a 15 or 31 during pegging, play the Zero-Card next to collect an additional 2 points for the 15 or 31. You must play the Zero-Card if you can played in a run or double run with zero, ace, and two.<br/><br/>The Super Ace: A Super-Ace pairs every ace. You can use a Super-Ace as a high ace for a run of queen, king and Super-Ace for both counting and pegging. The Super-Ace can be played as 1 or 11 during pegging. The value of the Super-Ace is 1 <u>and[/] 11 during counting (as though you had one of each card). The holder can also use as 1 and 11 with fours to total 15 points during counting the hand total.<br/><br/>Special Fives: Extra fives in play allows the high hand to go from 29 to 45 with 5 fives. The total points of  five 5&rsquo;s is 20. The 15 combinations are 20 and five pairs is another 20 making a total of 40 points.<br/><br/>Wild Cards: During pegging play you must use the Wild Card at the same face value as the point counting portion of the hand. Play a Wild Card as a seven during pegging, you must count it as a seven when you total your hand<br/><br/>The Super Wild: The Super-Wild is a Wild Card with one extra feature. It can be played during pegging as one face value and counted at another. You can play a Super-Wild as a seven during pegging and use it as a five during counting. If you play it as a 10 value you must specify it as a 10 or other face card value.<br/><br/>The Master: The Master is like a Super-Wild played as a separate face value during pegging and counting. The Master allows the extra option to play it after calling &lsquo;go&rsquo;.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Phil Martens", "Al Oller", "Bob Ramola"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game"], "name": "Mastermind Ultimate Cribbage", "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 1}, "72679": {"mechanics": ["Action Point Allowance System"], "usersrated": 2, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic761407.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 1, "trading": 0, "id": 72679, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 2, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic761407_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Bucephalus Games"], "families": [], "description": "From GTM Website:<br/><br/>&quot;The goal of One Thing, Two Thing, Red Thing, Blue Thing is to have the most Victory Points at the end of six rounds.

To start a round, a theme is shown, e.g. &quot;Women like it...&quot; Everyone thinks about this and selects a tile from his set, but does not show it to the other players. Players lay their tiles picture-side down on the table, and these tiles are mixed up with random tiles from the stock.<br/><br/>On the board there are slots which are numbered from 0 to 6. Tiles are placed next to slot 3 so that everyone can see the pictures. The goal for each player is to have his tile reach the top (slot 6) of the ranking of items that best meet the requirement. Each player receives points equal to the slot number where his tile is at the end of each round. The point total is reduced if another player correctly guesses which tile belongs to whom and marks it with the player's color.<br/><br/>When it is your turn, choose two tiles in the same row/slot and compare them to one another in meeting the requirement of the theme. (Important: You can only compare two tiles in the same row. If there is only one tile in row 4, you cannot compare this tile to one in a different row!)<br/>For example, say, &quot;I think women like lipstick more than a car.&quot; Then, you move the lipstick tile up one row and the car tile down one row. After you have done that, the others can guess your tile, by placing a stone of your color on any tile. Each player has only one stone of each color and can only guess the active player, so this must be done selectively and timely!<br/><br/>The round ends when one tile reaches the 6 slot and another is in the 0. Then, you calculate the points. Each player gets points equal his slot, minus every correct guess stone on the tile. So, if your tile is in slot 4, but there are 2 correct color stones are on it, you get only 2 points (4 - 2 = 2).<br/><br/>Before the beginning of the next round everyone gets a new picture tile from the stock and a new theme is shown.<br/><br/>The first player to score 15 points after a round ends the game and is the winner.

It is based around Space Pirates. Though similar to BANG!, there are several unique twists. Each player has his own unique objective, and his own unique card set based on his own unique alien race. Each player commands a ship that has 15 Hit Points. Hits are usually taken using Dice. However, while some players may have powerful attacks, the focus of the game for many players is not to destroy the other players but to accomplish an objective.<br/><br/>Samples:<br/>Akzinal - A traditional thief. His goal is to capture all treasures.<br/>Felian - A snakelike race, the Felian are tremendously territorial. Their objective is to be the last Faction standing.<br/>Homin - This hominid race lived relatively peacefully until an alien race sent an explosive that destroyed many lives, not including the lives that were lost. The Homin Captain seeks to find and neutralize the alien menace.<br/>Morph - As their name suggests, the Morph are a race of appearance-altering people who have developed their ships to transform as well. Always seeking to attain transcendence, the Morph try to do so by learning from other people. Their objective is to acquire technologies from all other factions.<br/>Ralyk - Wolf Men. Because their genetics prevent their reproduction, the only way they can continue as a race is to (naturally) turn others into Wolf Men. They prominently seek out the Alphas of each species. This said, their objective is to capture all opposing Captains through duel or by kidnapping.<br/>Var*por - A squidlike race who travel aboard live ships. These ships look like rays but hold solar powers. Thus they are called StarRay in first phase and SunRay in later phase. The objective is to raise a StarRay to its second phase and lead it to a New Birth phase where another StarRay is born.<br/>Wallaboo - A small teleporting Kangaroo race who stow away on ships and influence the playing field. They maneuver game play while attempting to remain unnoticed and escape capture. Their objective is to be free aboard the winning ship.<br/><br/>Objectives that are well thought out with interesting back-story, only made more incredible by the fact that this game is so easy to play.<br/><br/>As stated, each faction has their own unique abilities, but a shared deck unites them all. In this shared deck are Detonator Cards (the central card which allows players to make basic attacks or to play their faction cards), Evasion Tactics which protect ships from attack, Quick Fix cards to restore Hit Points, Steal cards that allow players to steal Faction abilities from other factions (including Captains and Treasures), Void cards which return continuous abilities to their decks, and other (more unique) abilities.<br/><br/>Dueling, a major factor of Traditional Bang, is now done exclusively in battle for captains. (All players may Duel for opposing captains, as Captain cards hold unique abilities. This was also true of Traditional Bang). This does not require the use of cards. Any player can Duel with an opponent that has less than 1/2 Hit Points. Each Captain has his own HP rating, and a series of D6 Dice Rolls resolves a Duel. The winner retains the opponent's captain along with his unique ability.<br/><br/>Another new feature of Shores of Heaven is a mini game called Common Threat, wherein 2 D6's are rolled and the values are multiplied. Players must work together to destroy the Common Threat before returning to play. Each player who fails to neutralize the threat loses 1 HP. The Victor redeems all lost HP.<br/><br/>FOLLOWING IS A SIMPLE RULE SET. SOON, WITH PRINTABLE CARDS TO BE UPLOADED, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME WITHIN A FEW MINUTES...<br/><br/>START <br/>Along with cards, you will need a D4 and a D6 to play. (Unique sided dice are usually inexpensive and can be found on the internet or at specialty board game shops.)<br/>After Starting Position has been determined, each player pulls a faction at random from the SPECIES deck. This card remains face up until the faction is removed from play. There are two SPECIES decks, only one of which has a WALLABOO card. If the WALLABOO card is chosen, the Wallaboo faction keeps the additional SPECIES deck to mark his current position. His position is revealed to only the player who plays the IMPRISONMENT card. (Each faction has an IMPRISONMENT card in his FACTION deck.) If the Wallaboo plays his TRUCE card, his position is then revealed to all players.<br/>At this point, all players but the Homin also receive a THREAT card, distinguishing them as a Menace or as Benign.<br/>OBJECTIVES:<br/>Akz&iacute;nal - Acquire all treasures. This can be done using a STEAL card from the SHARED deck or a FILCH card from your personal deck. The treasure is returned to your opponent if 1) It is VOIDED. 2) It is STOLEN. 3) It is taken back using 2 DETONATOR cards. 4) You are destroyed. (It is reshuffled into the FACTION deck.)<br/>Felian - Be the last Faction standing. Your Treasure card can help, as it allows you to regenerate after 1 round destroyed. This card stays in effect until it is stolen or voided.<br/>Homin - Hunt and neutralize the Menace. THREAT cards distributed at the start of play determine the Menace. If the Menace is destroyed by someone else, THREAT cards are redistributed. You must destroy the Menace yourself.<br/>Morph - Steal and hold Faction cards from each opponent. These are considered learned abilities, and may be made Lasting Effects, regardless of status, as long as your treasure is in play. (See CARD SYMBOLS for details.) Addendum: Wallaboo movement cards effect range. Sabotage card (in Wallaboo deck) counts against your HP, and is returned to the Wallaboo deck as soon as acquired.<br/>Ralyk - Acquire all Captains. This can be done using a Steal card, or by Dueling. (See CAPTAIN DUEL for details.) If an opponent&rsquo;s ship is destroyed, his captain is left out, and a Steal card can acquire the Captain for you. <br/>V&auml;r&middot;por - Raise your StarRay to New Birth phase. See SunRay gauge. (This is a narrow purple sheet marked with 15 movements and contains pictures of SunRays at all phases.)<br/>Wallaboo - Remain free aboard the winning faction&rsquo;s ship. If imprisoned (See Imprisonment cards), you cannot play any of your cards. You can, however, discard and collect cards each round until you hold the Escape card. (Since it has a cost of 2 Detonator cards, you will want those in your hand when you find it.)<br/>CARDS You will start with 2 FACTION cards and 5 SHARED DECK cards. This is the maximum number of cards you will hold in your hand. However, both at the start and end of your turn you will be able to replenish your hand. (Thus Attack does not penalyze Defense.) You may only discard unwanted cards at the end of your turn, before replenishing your hand. <br/>Cards of the same type may be stacked to boost effect. I.E. Because of this, a player who has 2 FOCUS cards may be able to roll a maximum value of 8 with a D4.<br/>CARD SYMBOLS Each card likely has 1 or both of 2 symbols. The first is LE (Lasting Effect). The card may be played down to be in permanent use. The second is #D. This indicates how many Detonator cards must be played to use the card. If the LE has a #D over it, this indicates that there is a cost to make the card a lasting effect. If the card has LE and #D on opposite cards, it may be played as a Lasting Effect but you must play as many Detonator cards for each use.<br/>CAPTAINS&rsquo; DUEL - Each Captain Card has a number in the upper right corner. This is how many hits a captain may take before he is defeated. Each time a Duel takes place, both captains start with full HP. Both captains roll a D6. When one opponent rolls higher, the opposite loses 1 HP. This is repeated until 1 captain is lost. Captains may only back out of a Captains&rsquo; Duel if a truce is agreed upon. The winner keeps the opponent&rsquo;s captain as prisoner and can use the additional Captain&rsquo;s ability freely. If you lose your Captain, you can only rescue the captain using a Steal card, or a Void card. Any captain can duel with an opponent&rsquo;s captain so long as the challenged opponent has less than &frac12; HP. <br/>VOID - This card usually means the opponent forfeit&rsquo;s a card of his choice. However, if you play a VOID card with a DETONATOR card, you may roll a D4. Rolling a 4 or higher (using bonus cards) can give you the ability to choose which Lasting Effects are voided. This can prove a useful tool in recollecting Captains and Treasures as the VOID card returns cards to their Faction decks.<br/>COMMON THREAT - When this card is found, it is played immediately. Roll 2 D6&rsquo;s, and multiply the scores. Each player in succession uses their attack cards to destroy the common threat. If the player fails to destroy the threat, he loses 1 HP. This continues until the threat is destroyed. The Victor receives all lost HP. The player of this card may determine the initial opponent after the dice roll. (This means that some clever calculation can result in a quick HP boost for him.)<br/>RANGE  - Unless otherwise stated, all attacks have a range of 1 in either direction. Captains&rsquo; Duel is maximum range. <br/>TREASURES - All opponents may steal treasures to use opponents&rsquo; treasure abilities.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 4, "averageweight": 1.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Iffix Y.

This game is now sold out. -- John Kranz, Consim Press<br/><br/><br/>The Situation<br/><br/>On December 9th, 1940, the British Western Desert Force launched their first offensive of World War Two, catching the Italian 10th Army completely off guard. Although greatly outnumbered, the British dominated by outmaneuvering the Italians with their superior armored vehicles. In the battles of Sidi Barani, Bardia, Tobruk, and Mechili, the Italian 10th Army had been soundly defeated but remained intact to defend the gates of Tripoli.<br/><br/>On this, the 58th day of the offensive, the remaining operational tanks of 7th British Armoured Division and a small advanced detachment of men, guns, and armored cars are attempting to block the last escape route for the Italians.<br/><br/>The Italians, yet unaware of the fast approaching Western Desert blocking force, will soon find themselves desperately racing against time to break through near the small village of Beda Fomm and escape into Tripolitania before it&rsquo;s too late.<br/><br/>The time is 1200 hrs, 5 February 1941<br/><br/>The complete destruction of the remnants of the Italian 10th Army hangs in the balance.<br/><br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>Beda Fomm marks the triumphant return of one of the truly classic gaming gems originally released in 1979 by Game Designers Workshop during what many consider the heyday of traditional conflict simulation gaming. This fast-playing, operational-level game of the Battle of Beda Fomm represents a classic blend of simple gaming mechanics with nail-biting action suitable for solitaire or competition play.<br/> Relive the drama as the British player, maneuvering your outnumbered but superior armored vehicles and supporting personnel and weapon units to cut-off and summarily destroy the retreating Italian forces. As the Italian player, you have strength in overall numbers, but your formations are brittle and are hampered by a lack of maneuverability in attempting to break through and escape complete destruction. Simple mechanics capture the flavor of desert warfare along with the unique qualities and characteristics of the opposing forces.<br/><br/>This Consim Press edition represents a re-mastering of the original release by introducing many enhancements while remaining true to the original game design.

The players take the role of project managers in a company. At the start of the game each player has a single project in play. Projects begin in a single space on the board, and each turn grow out one space orthogonally in all directions.  On a player's turn only his or her projects grow.<br/><br/>If a project grows into the edge of the board, the game ends in a loss for all players.<br/><br/>To finish projects, players utilize a mix of concept work and production work tokens. Placing a token on the board blocks projects from growing into that space.  If a project cannot grow it counts as finished, and the players score one point. After a project is completed, a replacement is added in a semi-random square.<br/><br/>Concept work tokens are taken from a shared pool of 10, and once placed remain in play indefinitely.<br/><br/>Additionally, each player has 2 production work tokens. These tokens only last for one round.<br/><br/>A player's turn consists of doing one of the following: placing a single concept work token, moving a single concept work token, or placing both production work tokens.<br/><br/>That player then grows his or her projects. If two (or more) projects collide they combine into a single compound project. Compound projects grow on the turns of every player who has a project involved, and their multiple growth points make them much harder to finish. Additionally, compound projects are still only worth a single point.<br/><br/>The players win if they can finish eight projects.

To continue on, to reverse direction and move, or to roll the Die of Power; the Die of Power may cause you to lose your turn, reclaim an energy disk, move 5 spaces or teleport to any space, designate another player to lose a disk, or let you become the Turbo Cochon (Pig), who teleports, forces another player to lose an energy disk, and collects that disk all in one fell swoop.

The games are ideal for children 7 to 13 to play with parents, siblings, or friends. Children a little younger can play them with an adult or older child. The directions include ways to adjust the games to fit the age and experience of the players.<br/><br/>Games included are: (1) Guess my state; (2) Take a trip; (3) Guess my rule; (4) Capture states; and (5) Closest match.<br/><br/>(1) Guess my state - In this game, similar to &quot;Twenty Questions,&quot; players ask questions to try to identify a secret state that one player has chosen. At the start of the game, the state cards are laid out face up. Players take turns tryin to identify the secret state by asking yes-or-no questions (e.g., Did it become a state in the 1800s? Does your state border Canada?). After each question is answered, the states that have been ruled out are removed from the layout. The player who narrows the layout down to the secret state is the winner. Use either the East or West cards, or for more of a challenge, play with all 50 state cards.<br/><br/>(2) Take a trip - In this game, players navigate around the U.S. by finding states that border one another. At the start of the game, one state card is turned up. On the first turn, a player puts down a state card that borders it from their hand of 3 cards. The next player puts down a card that borders that state, and so on. For example, if Texas is turned up at the start of the game, on the first turn a player could put down Oklahoma, since it borders Texas. On the second turn, a player could put down Kansas, since it borders Oklahoma. The game is over when one player plays all of their cards or no more cards can be placed. Use either the East or West cards, or for more of a challenge, play with all 50 state cards. May also be played cooperatively with all players' cards face up.<br/><br/>(3) Guess my rule - In this game,players try to discover a secret rule that one player is using to sort the states into two groups. For instance, a secret rule could be &quot;borders on an ocean.&quot; States that border an ocean would go in one group; states that do not border an ocean would go in the other group. the Rule Maker selects about six states form the layout ans sorts them into two groups according to the rule. Players take turns trying to figure out the rule by choosing a state that has not yet been sorted and saying which group they think it belongs in. After three turns in a row in which players sort states correctly, they may begin to guess the rule. The first player to guess the rule wins. Use either the East or West cards, or for more of a challenge, play with all 50 state cards.<br/><br/>(4) Capture states - In this game, similar to &quot;War,&quot;players compare the states according to a certain feature. At the start of the game, players choose a state feature, such as year of statehood. On each round, all players put out a state card at the same time from their stack of face down cards. The player with the state that has the biggest number for the chosen feature (e.g., became a state most recently) captures all the cards played in the round. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>(5) Closest match - In this game, players use math to find states that are most alike. At the start of the game, players choose a state feature, such as number of libraries. In each round, they compare the states in their hand to a Goal state. For instance, if the Goal is Colorado, which has 253 libraries, they find the card in their hand of five cards that has closest to 253 libraries. They compare their chosen states, and the player with the closest of all takes the cards played in the round. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/> - large map of U.S. for reference<br/> - 26 Blue fact cards, one for each of <br/>   the states in the Eastern U.S. <br/>   (sorry, no Washington, D.C.)<br/> - 24 Red fact cards, one for each of <br/>   the states in the Western U.S.<br/> - 10 Wild cards<br/> - 10 sample rules/question cards<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": [], "categories": ["Children's Game", "Educational"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "USA by the numbers", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 2}, "77130": {"mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Deck / Pool Building", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Rock-Paper-Scissors", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Trading", "Variable Player Powers"], "usersrated": 11068, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic798666.jpg", "wishing": 2706, "owned": 14395, "trading": 511, "id": 77130, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 948, "wanting": 476, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic798666_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Unknown)", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment", "Delta Vision Publishing", "Edge Entertainment", "Fantasmagoria", "Fantasy Flight Games", "Galakta", "Giochi Uniti", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Hobby Japan", "Hobby World", "Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.", "Stratelibri", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd."], "families": ["4X games", "Civilization"], "description": "Please note: this entry covers the 2010 release of Sid Meier&rsquo;s Civilization: The Board Game from FFG.

The point of this game is to simulate small-scale battles and to play as well as possible and to have fun, win or not.<br/>Skirmish! is intended for both veteran and novice players.  It is simple enough to be a beginner's first wargame, and versatile and expandable enough to satisfy more experienced gamers, especially those who want to pull out some of their old toy soldiers out of a footlocker or the closet and use them in a game.<br/><br/>Skirmish! is designed for simplicity and playability.  The basic rules can be read, a handful of soldiers selected, and a game set up in about 20 minutes, and in much less time than that for players already familiar with the rules.  And, while their emphasis is on playability, these rules allow for consistency, taking the gaming action up at least a few steps from merely &quot;playing soldiers&quot;.<br/><br/>Would-be hardcore gamers mau complain that these rules are not &quot;realistic&quot;.  Sure they are.  They are just exceptionally streamlined, and in the spirit of &quot;playing soldiers&quot; are simple and flexible.  There are no cumbersome charts or combat matrices, no supporting papaerwork to keep track of a game in play, and a minimum of simple tables.  Most attacks can be completely resolved with a simple roll of the dice.<br/><br/>Anything beyond the basic rules is optional.  With the incorporation of selected optional rules, Skirmish! can be made as complex as is enjoyable for the players.  Most players will eventually, if not initially, want to use some of the optional rules.<br/><br/>From RPGnow.com:<br/><br/>This book is part of a thematic series of works on miniatures wargaming published by Skirmisher that includes the H.G.

The players will lead one of these city-states (like Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Thebes, Argos and others) expanding it and worshipping the various gods in order to become the hegemonic power of the Peloponnesus!<br/><br/>Olympus is a deterministic (i.e., non-random) strategy game, based on worker-placement, resource management and building an efficient engine to score victory points (VPs). It also features a few more aggressive options than the average game based on the same premises (but the savvy player knows how to defend against them, if he prefers to quietly develop his own position).<br/><br/>Each player leads a city-state that is defined by six values representing population, culture, military and productivity of the three resources (grain, venison and fish). During your turn, you send one of your three priests to worship one of the ten deities (Zeus, Hera, Demetra, Artemis, Poseidon, Athena, Aphrodite, Ares, Hephaestus or Apollo). Each opponent can now send one of his priests to celebrate the ceremony with you. After that, the deity grants his favor to whoever has sent a worshipper: the favor is larger for the leading priest (the one of the active player) and smaller for all the others (for example, Athena boosts culture by two points for the city of leading priest and by one point for the others; of course no boost is given to those who refused to send a priest to worship her). That deity cannot be chosen again in the current turn.<br/><br/>Since almost all deities are specialized in a certain field, the players must choose which ones they prefer to worship sooner (also guessing which ones may be of interest for the opponents and which ones are safer to skip as they will not be chosen until later) and when it is better to get a smaller benefit following the priest of another player rather than saving a priest to get a greater boon but in a field that may not interest them as much (sort of quality over quantity).<br/><br/>The resources your city produces (worshipping the correct deities) can be spent (worshipping other deities) to create buildings giving a variety of effects (and VPs), thus offering a lot of different strategic approaches to the game. Victory can be achieved with a plethora of buildings but also with very few ones. There are 45 different buildings: 33 can be built by anyone (even if someone else already did), while the other 12 are unique as only one copy of each can exist (introducing another element of contention between the players). You can also wage war to steal the resources of the other cities (if they were so foolish to keep their warehouses full and their military underdeveloped, it's just what they deserve) or invoke a terrible plague to decimate their population.<br/><br/>All the actions (development, production, building, war, scoring, etc.) are done by worshipping the proper deity (and some gods give you a choice like &quot;do you develop your grain productivity &ndash; thus receiving more grain the next time you will produce it &ndash; or do you produce it now even if you won't get much?&quot;, adding crucial tactical decisions to the game).<br/><br/>When all the priests have been used, there's a brief upkeep to check some simple conditions (e.g., players with more than five unused resources must discard those in excess) and then a new turn begins (all priests return home and all deities can be worshipped again).<br/><br/>Being the first to reach the maximum value in a certain field (e.g. culture 10) gives you an award worth two VPs. When four of these awards are claimed, the game ends.

Some of the pieces, or some of the squares where the pieces can be placed, have specific properties that affect how that particular turn is played. Players who can't, in their turn, place the required pieces on the squares of the board are eliminated.

Who plays first?<br/>Let the players throw the die and the person with the highest number goes first.

If you happen to draw a special piece or the last piece happens to end in a special square, certain other rules apply.<br/><br/>5) It's my first turn. I've rolled the die.

The line, except obviously in the first turn, must always start from a preexisting piece belonging to the current player.<br/><br/>7) What are special squares?<br/>Special squares are clearly marked squares on the board that have a unique propertie. When a line, in a turn, ends on a special square, the current player can place, if possible, an extra piece on any other free special square in the board. This only happens when the turn ends on a special square, not when it crosses a special square. The extra piece is only taken from the nontransparent bag when all other pieces are in place.<br/><br/>8) And special pieces? What are they?<br/>Special pieces are distinctly marked pieces that allow the player to convert, if possible, adjacent opponent pieces into his own. They are mixed up with the normal pieces in the nontransparent bag and are taken, eventually, by chance, when the player is taking the number of pieces obtained by the role of the die or taking a piece for a special square as described above. Special pieces can be used at any point of the line and in any direction as chosen by the current player. The drawing in the special piece shows the allowed positions from which the opponent&acute;s piece(s) can be converted into a player&acute;s piece. In the drawing, on the piece, a dark circle represents the player special piece and the light circles represent the the allowed conversion positions.<br/><br/>Description from the author.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Sector", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "80447": {"mechanics": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Co-operative Play", "Pick-up and Deliver"], "usersrated": 1, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic823845.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 3, "trading": 0, "id": 80447, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic823845_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Unpublished)", "(Web published)"], "families": [], "description": "Designer Summary:<br/><br/>For ages, the studious inhabitants of Cogsburg lived without fear, happily ticking along as they went about their business.

The game pieces are set-up in a traditional football formation, on a twenty-four square by ten square checkered football field board. The object of the game, like football, is to outscore the opponent. One player manages the offensive game pieces, trying to maneuver the quarterback towards the opponent&rsquo;s end zone for a score (touchdown or field goal). The other player manages the defensive game pieces, trying to capture the quarterback or prevent its advancement toward the goal line.<br/><br/>Pieces are moved one at a time, similar to chess, beginning with the offensive team, then alternating to the defensive team. Each game piece is assigned a specific directional pattern of movement. Once a piece is captured it is removed from the game board. If the quarterback is captured, players switch roles, with the defensive team becoming the offensive team at the point of capture and vice versa. All pieces are returned to the board and play resumes.<br/><br/>Scoring: A touchdown is seven points; a field goal is three points; a safety is two points.<br/><br/>Game Timing: The game is played in two halves or four fifteen minute quarters.  Each coach is allowed three timeouts per half.<br/><br/>Play timing: The offensive coach has thirty seconds to move a piece.  The defensive coach has fifteen seconds to make a responding move, which makes for a fast-paced and pressure packed game of strategic fun.<br/><br/>This description is attributed to Cort Hubbard, the game designer.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": [], "categories": ["Sports"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Quarterback King", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 90, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "73114": {"mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Deck / Pool Building", "Hand Management"], "usersrated": 493, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic745671.jpg", "wishing": 53, "owned": 1611, "trading": 99, "id": 73114, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 21, "wanting": 9, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic745671_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG)", "Arclight", "Pegasus Spiele", "Wargames Club Publishing"], "families": ["BoardGameGeek Promo Offerings", "Promotional Cards", "Thunderstone"], "description": "From deep within the halls of Stonehold, the dwarven clans feel the Thunderstone's rumble&hellip; its calling power.

The Israelis were therefore badly outnumbered, but were quickly reinforced by reservists (much sooner than the Syrians had anticipated). More significantly, the Israeli Air Force appeared overhead to impede the Syrian assault.

But Golan also introduces a new element to the battlefield: surface to air missiles. The Syrians fielded numerous SAM batteries during their advance, downing many Israeli jets and compelling that air force to implement new tactics. A single armor battalion, for example &mdash; perhaps supported by air support &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy commando brigade defending a fort.

However, if one of the claimants can provide a more conducive shelter for the pet, he will be given the pet during a confrontation.

The momentum of the dropped marble is transferred in up to eight (orthogonal and diagonal) directions through adjacent contiguous lines of marbles. The last marble at the end of each of these lines is pushed away one cell from the dropped marble.

If either player has a majority of marbles on the board that player wins, if not, the game ends in a draw.

Both provide some cover for our valiant heroes as they strive to retrieve the warhead and save the day.<br/><br/>Players deal a deck of cards to construct the board they will navigate, then use a second deck to place the player pieces, the robot counters, and the warhead.  A die is rolled for each robot, assigning it a movement pattern.  Players may move through two empty spaces, through one grass space, may climb a wall or climb down a wall each turn.  If they approach a robot from the rear and have only moved one space, they may use the additional movement to attack the robot, which will disable it if successful or change the machine's movement pattern if not.<br/><br/>Robots see only in the direction they are facing, and if the player is in their line of sight, he rolls to see if he is spotted. If in the same space, the player needs to roll better than a 6 on 1d6, if one space away, a 5 or better and so on.  Being in or behind grass increases the player's roll by 1, actively hiding adds 2 to the roll.  If sighted, the robot will move directly to the player, even through grass (though normally robots turn when they run into grass), proceeding to the tile the player was last seen at, then resuming their pattern.  Robots move 2 spaces per turn, 1 if through grass, and cannot climb.  If a robot has sighted a player and enters the players' space, or a sighted player enter's the robot's space from the direction the robot is facing, the player dies.  Player wins when all robots are disabled or the warhead is recovered and returned to the player's origin tile.<br/>Note: Changing facing counts as a move, i.e., a player or robot may move 2 or move one and turn one facing, or move 2 facings if not in grass.  If in grass, a player or robot may EITHER move 1, or change one facing. A player can change facing while on top of a wall, but will not be able to do it in the same round as he climbs up or down, as it will 2 moves to do either.  Walls completely hide whatever is behind them, but not what is on top of them.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 0.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Tim Park"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Maze", "Print & Play", "Science Fiction"], "name": "Lawnmower Wars I: Sneak in the Grass", "playingtime": 20, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "76394": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "usersrated": 2, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1204653.png", "wishing": 1, "owned": 1, "trading": 0, "id": 76394, "yearpublished": 2010, "maxplayers": 8, "numweights": 0, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1204653_t.png", "publishers": ["The Game Crafter, LLC"], "families": [], "description": "INTRODUCTION:<br/>&quot;Captain, we are breaking Earth's orbit...&quot;<br/>&quot;Great.

That approach allows for the smooth building into the system of what would otherwise be burdensome factors of weather, ground conditions, operational tempo, etc. Every ground unit represents a division or division-equivalent (176 large-size NATO-style).<br/><br/>The game uses the well-liked system originally created by Ben Knight for Victory in Normandy.

It starts with the first uprisings against the Axis in Bosnia, Serbia and Montenegro in late 1941, and ends in late 1944 just before the Soviet Army entered the country. The game is won by the Partisan player by waging an aggressive guerilla war: harassing the occupiers and destroying infrastructure that may be of use to them: warehouses, fuel dumps, bridges, dams, depots, railroads, viaducts, motor pools, etc (each represented by variably placed counters). &ldquo;Resource hexes&rdquo; represent strategic mineral deposits, such as bauxite, copper and chromium, which the Axis player must protect, along with routes from them back to Germany, while also guarding possible invasion beaches along the coast.<br/><br/>During the game, the exact strengths of Partisan units are mostly unknown by the Axis player (via &ldquo;tried&rdquo; and &ldquo;untried&rdquo; counter-sides). He must attempt to head off Partisan operations while never certain exactly where they&rsquo;re headed. The Partisan player must select his targets carefully in order to disrupt the occupation enough for him to win the game, while avoiding becoming surrounded and destroyed by the Germans in the process.<br/><br/>The counter-mix includes the full German, Italian, Hungarian, Croatian, Bulgarian, and Ustashi orders of battle, as well as all the Partisan forces and Marshall Tito himself (the Chetniks are handled abstractly). The Partisans may even expect support from the Anglo-Allies if the guerilla war against the Axis is going well, including possibly an amphibious invasion by the Anglo-Americans (&ldquo;Operation Armpit&rdquo;). In fact, most of the main Axis' operations in Yugoslavia historically pertained to the protection of their coastal flank. Their primary anti-partisan offensives were intended to clear the guerrillas from the coastal areas where an Allied invasion was possible. In game terms, the &quot;Allied Landing Scare&quot; rule simulates the reality of German strategic fears in the Balkans.<br/><br/>Axis forces, especially the Germans, are generally stronger than the partisans, but the partisans are elusive and difficult to catch, often forcing the Axis player to spread thin his forces.

The Allied plan, although inelegant, proved to be successful as the odds allowed them to attack everywhere and keep the advantage. Even though using the interior lines, Napoleon was rarely in a position to take a serious strategic advantage while winning almost every of these battles because a 1:2 odd can not lead to a decisive victory against determined enemies.<br/><br/>However, you are now in charge of the army, and things can turn very different...<br/><br/>&quot;Vive l&rsquo;Empereur!&quot; is a series of simulation games using a standard rules system and a set of exclusive rules specific to each battle.

Hidden, Attercop stalks - probing, deceiving, sneaking for her prey.<br/><br/>It's devious, it's cunning, it's sneaking good fun !<br/><br/>How the game is played, from game designer :-<br/><br/>Attercop is a game for two players. One player is Attercop, a spider with a reputation for cunning, and a lady with an appetite. The other is Meratoo, a little spider nervously trying to cross her web. The aim of the game is for Meratoo to make his way from one side of the web to the other, whilst Attercop tries to catch him.<br/><br/>The web consists of 44 connected points, each covered by a &quot;blank&quot; tile.  Meratoo travels from blank tile to blank tile, gently feeling his way accross the Web trying to avoid running into Attercop. Meanwhile, Attercop has a number of tiles to represent her legs, which tease the web and try to bluff the Meratoo player into her grasp, by being able the change the position of the tiles on the web. Here's the catch: the Attercop tiles remain face-down on the web, undistinguishable from the blank tiles, and they can be moved along with the rest of the web tiles. This is how Attercop probes her way around the web.<br/><br/>For Attercop the game is all about bluffing and enticing Meratoo into her grasp. For Meratoo it is all about staying alert, testing the web and calling Attercop's bluff. The game is fun to play, generates lots of laughs , is a light-hearted and quick game, and is great for both kids and adults.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 4.0, "bayesaverage": 0.0, "designers": ["Richard Wilkins"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Animals", "Bluffing", "Print & Play"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Attercop", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 5, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "Not Ranked"}], "average": 0.0, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 0.0, "numcomments": 0}, "73437": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 3, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1070057.jpg", "wishing": 1, "owned": 7, "trading": 0, "id": 73437, "yearpublished": 2009, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 1, "wanting": 0, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1070057_t.jpg", "publishers": ["(Web published)"], "families": ["Sci-Fi Sports"], "description": "&quot;In the future, a new high-tech sport will become popular.

It uses the Napoleon's Later Campaigns system, for a fast, low to moderate complexity, brigade-level game of Napoleonic battles.  Interactive Sequence of play, orders, and a modern, fire-based combat system (no odds optimising!).  To win, you have to use your army like a Napoleonic commander. Maintaining morale is the key. Running away will inspire defeatism in your troops just as heavy losses, but no side will emerge unscratched when encountering the enemy. Among all this you have to contend with multiple subordinates on a battlefield where no information can be sent faster than a rider can go.  How you are able to orchestrate your leaders to enable effective concentration of force will decide the battle.<br/><br/>The system combines a grand tactical perspective (battle strategy, not micromanagement) with a focus on a historically sound use of your units. Four pages of basic rules aim at an easy entry into the world of Napoleonic command and combined arms with four types of orders and assault combat, cavalry charges, and artillery bombardment. Nine pages of full rules add concepts such as additional order types, written orders (although markers are provided for those who do not wish to write), reaction charges, and enfilading fire.  Finally, 2 pages of Advanced and Optional rules add hidden movement, division level doctrine, and others.<br/><br/>The Salamanca special rules deal with particular units of the campaign (such as the British Light Division), reverse slope defense (used by the French in this battle!), and supply.  Scenarios cover the historical battle (playing time 2-3 hours between experienced players), and the full day (3-4 hours), enabling both sides to set the strategy for the battle as they choose.
