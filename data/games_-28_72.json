Take It Easy is a true multi-player solitaire in which each player individually completes a hexagon-shaped board with spots for 19 hexagon tiles. There's no limit to number of players if you've got enough sets on hand. One person (the caller) draws a tile randomly and tells the others which of the 27 tiles featuring colored/numbered lines crossing in three directions, with numbers from 1 to 9, it is. &quot;The 9-8-7,&quot; for example. Each player then chooses which empty spot on his own board he'll play the 9-8-7. This is repeated until the boards are filled.<br/><br/>The idea is to complete same-numbered lines across your board. Scoring is calculated by multiplying the number on the tile with the number of tiles in the completed line. A complete column of three 9s is worth 27, for example...but a lot of players will hope for five 9s to fill the big column down the middle.<br/><br/>Take It Easy is often compared to Bingo because of the familiar pattern of a number being called and then everybody looking at their cards to play it, and then scoring if a line is completed. But that's as far as the comparison goes.  Bingo is sheer luck; Take It Easy is a game of skill.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 1, "averageweight": 1.5075, "bayesaverage": 6.24738, "designers": ["Peter Burley"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Puzzle"], "name": "Aeg Maha!", "playingtime": 20, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "1270"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "72"}], "average": 6.58645, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.31725, "numcomments": 634}, "130": {"mechanics": ["Crayon Rail System", "Pick-up and Deliver"], "usersrated": 1362, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic55970.jpg", "wishing": 193, "owned": 1835, "trading": 59, "id": 130, "yearpublished": "1994", "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 140, "wanting": 68, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic55970_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Mayfair Games"], "families": ["Empire Builder Rail Games"], "description": "From the box: &quot;Iron Dragon&trade; takes railroading games where they have never gone before -- to a land filled with elves, cat-people, trolls and magic.

Players offer trades by crying out the number of cards they want to swap (&ldquo;One! One! One!&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Three! Three! Three!&rdquo;) but not their identity. The winner of the hand is the first to collect all of one commodity, declaring &ldquo;Corner on Wheat!&rdquo; or whatever commodity has been collected. The winner of the hand scores points equal to the value of the commodity, and the winner of the game is the first to 500 points.<br/><br/>The 1904 Edition of Pit added much fancier artwork and the famous Bull and Bear cards, which provide wild-card and penalty features. The early editions allowed a maximum of 7 players, but later versions supported 8 and in at least one case up to 10.<br/><br/>Pit&rsquo;s designer, noted psychic Edgar Cayce, is often accused of having stolen the idea from the game Gavitt&rsquo;s Stock Exchange (G-S-E) invented by Harry Gavitt. While G-S-E claimed patents dating as early as 1896, it involved trading railway shares, and was only copyrighted and published in 1903, the same year as Pit.

Celebrate one of our most vital and enduring passions: railroads.  Use your initial investment to build track.

Complete a delivery and make the money you need to buy larger, faster trains, and expand your railroad empire.  Win the game by building the most effective railroad empire!<br/><br/>The original and flagship of Mayfair's crayon-rails line allows players, using washable crayons, to draw their train routes over a map of North America.  Players start with an initial sum of money which they use to build short lengths of track during their first couple of turns.  For the rest of the game, players operate their trains over the track network drawn on the board to pick up and deliver loads to various cities, and then have the opportunity to add to their track network or improve their train.  The game uses demand cards which list three demands, each of a commodity to be delivered to a specified city for a given payoff.  Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income.<br/><br/>Each turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase.  During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player's demand cards.  When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one.  Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards.  When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed.  During the building phase a player may pay to build more track or upgrade his train.<br/><br/>A player wins by being the first to connect his track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.6367, "bayesaverage": 6.49738, "designers": ["Darwin Bromley", "Bill Fawcett"], "categories": ["Economic", "Trains", "Transportation"], "playingtime": 180, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "830"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "510"}], "average": 6.91717, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.44313, "numcomments": 886}, "169": {"mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Point to Point Movement"], "usersrated": 1374, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic620883.jpg", "wishing": 316, "owned": 1788, "trading": 67, "id": 169, "yearpublished": "1993", "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 114, "wanting": 117, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic620883_t.jpg", "publishers": ["ABACUSSPIELE", "Eagle-Gryphon Games", "Ferti", "New Games Order, LLC"], "families": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Gryphon Two-Player Games series", "Sports: Combat Sports / Martial Arts"], "description": "Experience the thrill of fencing&mdash; board game style!

Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typicially featuring games and commentary by chess masters.<br/><br/>The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from a similar, much older game of Indian origin. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886.

The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).<br/><br/>A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.<br/><br/>The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 3.088, "bayesaverage": 7.68718, "designers": ["Wolfgang Kramer", "Richard Ulrich"], "categories": ["Renaissance"], "name": "El Grande", "playingtime": 120, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "42"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "34"}], "average": 7.81051, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.34107, "numcomments": 4535}, "94": {"mechanics": ["Card Drafting", "Route/Network Building", "Stock Holding"], "usersrated": 3906, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic226392.jpg", "wishing": 566, "owned": 3890, "trading": 153, "id": 94, "yearpublished": "1999", "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 460, "wanting": 248, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic226392_t.jpg", "publishers": ["999 Games", "AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH", "Rio Grande Games"], "families": ["Country: USA"], "description": "Union Pacific is a train-themed stock market game.

In these instances the Boarding Parties portion comes into play.  Here players line up their ships next to one another and attempt to storm the other ship and kill the opposing captain.  Players can only move a limited amount of their units each turn and so some planning is required to hem in the opposing captain.<br/><br/>The components for the game are quite elaborate.
