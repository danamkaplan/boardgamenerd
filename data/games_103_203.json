The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.<br/><br/>Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).<br/>  <br/>     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.<br/><br/>Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.<br/><br/>The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.<br/><br/>As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.<br/><br/>Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.

Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.<br/><br/>A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.<br/><br/>Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points.

If only 1 player chose a particular action, they simply perform that action. If 2 players chose the same action, they barter back and forth with gemstones. One player will eventually accept the other's offer of gems, and the other will take the action. If 3 or 4 players all chose the same action card, that action is cancelled. Note that in 4-player games, there will always be a conflict in choice of 3 actions, so much more negotiating goes on.<br/><br/>A new turn begins with everyone rolling their die, moving, then choosing and revealing their action cards. When any merchant piece completes a lap around the board, the round ends and bonus points are awarded based on who has the majority in each gem color and who has completed a lap. After three rounds, the game is over and the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/><br/>     Edel, Stein & Reich<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 1.858, "bayesaverage": 6.30752, "designers": ["Reinhard Staupe"], "categories": ["Negotiation"], "name": "Basari", "playingtime": 25, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "1153"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "609"}], "average": 6.78164, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.21253, "numcomments": 626}, "15": {"mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "usersrated": 3607, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic428608.jpg", "wishing": 401, "owned": 3957, "trading": 205, "id": 15, "yearpublished": 1977, "maxplayers": 6, "numweights": 416, "wanting": 115, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic428608_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Alga", "ASS Altenburger Spielkarten", "Descartes Editeur", "Eon", "Games Workshop Ltd.", "Grow Jogos e Brinquedos", "Tsukuda Hobby / Original", "West End Games"], "families": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Cosmic Encounter"], "description": "By request of Fantasy Flight Games, Board Game Geek lists the various editions of Cosmic Encounter in separate entries.

They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyer belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. (source: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon</a>)<br/><br/><br/><br/>In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.<br/><br/>In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!<br/><br/>Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.<br/><br/>The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.4329, "bayesaverage": 7.05525, "designers": ["Richard Garfield"], "categories": ["Miniatures", "Racing", "Science Fiction"], "name": "Robo Rally", "playingtime": 120, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "273"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "99"}], "average": 7.16469, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.51575, "numcomments": 4937}, "19": {"mechanics": ["Tile Placement", "Voting"], "usersrated": 1437, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic786075.jpg", "wishing": 122, "owned": 2351, "trading": 169, "id": 19, "yearpublished": 1991, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 150, "wanting": 51, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic786075_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Hans im Gl\u00fcck Verlags-GmbH", "Mayfair Games"], "families": [], "description": "A long time ago, in a village far, far away, some disturbed townsfolk decided to destroy their entire town in order to rid themselves of an evil menace (it's technically a dog-mouse, but I think it's an idiomatic thing).  Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads.  To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses.  When an outhouse would be destroyed, players take a vote on whether to place that particular section.  Each player is trying to retain the most of one type of building, and once all the pieces have been placed the winner is the person with the highest valued buildings still standing.<br/><br/>Wacky, Wacky West re-make description:<br/><br/>Fans of Klaus Teuber will be interested in this remake/redesign of Drunter und Dr&uuml;ber, a 1991 Spiel des Jahres winner.<br/><br/><br/>Just south of nowhere, there's the junction of the Mayfair &amp; Rossdorf RR and the Turvy Trunk Line. Springing up from the desert like a tumbleweed lies the eccentric little town of Rossdorf. Like most western towns, Rossdorf has a Land Agent: Guy Dough, the brother of that wicked varmint Black Benny. A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mind-marbling drink the locals call &quot;Wacky Water!&quot; <br/><br/><br/>Now that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment #5, which states: &quot;no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens...&quot; Now one thing's for sure: something's gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon.....<br/><br/><br/>In Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings. Every time someone tries to build over a precious outhouse, the town votes! You try to enlist your supporters (represented by cards) to vote with you to stop or encourage the play of certain tiles-perhaps saving some of your buildings or taking out those of your dastardly opponents.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.8467, "bayesaverage": 5.99027, "designers": ["Klaus Teuber"], "categories": ["American West", "Bluffing", "City Building"], "name": "Drunter & Dr\u00fcber", "playingtime": 45, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "1980"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "569"}], "average": 6.31269, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.20342, "numcomments": 463}, "20": {"mechanics": ["Action Point Allowance System"], "usersrated": 588, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic451783.jpg", "wishing": 324, "owned": 781, "trading": 24, "id": 20, "yearpublished": 1988, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 54, "wanting": 181, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic451783_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Ludod\u00e9lire"], "families": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!"], "description": "In this game of science fiction strip mining, players land on a planet and try and grab as much ore as possible and take off before the game is over.

Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.<br/>To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.<br/><br/>As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.<br/><br/>MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.<br/>The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.<br/><br/>Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises.

Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.<br/><br/>Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris &amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This &quot;ziggurat expansion&quot;, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile.

The game consists of a single deck of cards of rank 2&ndash;10 in 5 different colors with 3 special &quot;handshakes&quot; (&quot;HS&quot; in scoring examples below) in each suit. There is also a board which functions only to hold and organize discarded cards and is largely superfluous. Games last around 15 minutes. This is generally considered a good &quot;couples&quot; game and is often recommended for people with non-gamer partners.<br/><br/>The object the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the 5 colors. On a player's turn they must always first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the appropriate discard pile, and then draw one card. There is a separate discard pile for each color and a player may draw the top card of any discard pile or the top card of the deck. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.<br/><br/>The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the draw pile. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total. Expeditions start at a value of -20 so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least 8 cards played into it. The player with the most points wins the game, but it is typical to play 3 matches and add your score from each to see who wins.<br/><br/>Scoring example 1: an expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 minus the initial -20.<br/><br/>Scoring example 2: an expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, minus the initial 20, &times;3 for the 2 multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.<br/><br/>Scoring example 3: an expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17.

The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.

After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).<br/><br/>A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.<br/><br/>The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region.

It is a light tactical war game during the age of sail where two ships face off against one another on the sea.  There are basically two layers to the game, the broadsides portion in which players plot their movement with a deck of cards, attempting to maneuver their ships in such a way that they can fire a volley of cannon balls at the opponent while minimizing the risk of return fire.<br/><br/>The second layer of the game begins when the movement of ships results in them bumping into one another.  In these instances the Boarding Parties portion comes into play.  Here players line up their ships next to one another and attempt to storm the other ship and kill the opposing captain.  Players can only move a limited amount of their units each turn and so some planning is required to hem in the opposing captain.<br/><br/>The components for the game are quite elaborate.  Each player is given a fully detailed plastic ship about a foot long with removable masts.  Also, each player is given a whole crew of little plastic pirate figures, cannon, and captain.

Take It Easy is a true multi-player solitaire in which each player individually completes a hexagon-shaped board with spots for 19 hexagon tiles. There's no limit to number of players if you've got enough sets on hand. One person (the caller) draws a tile randomly and tells the others which of the 27 tiles featuring colored/numbered lines crossing in three directions, with numbers from 1 to 9, it is. &quot;The 9-8-7,&quot; for example. Each player then chooses which empty spot on his own board he'll play the 9-8-7. This is repeated until the boards are filled.<br/><br/>The idea is to complete same-numbered lines across your board. Scoring is calculated by multiplying the number on the tile with the number of tiles in the completed line. A complete column of three 9s is worth 27, for example...but a lot of players will hope for five 9s to fill the big column down the middle.<br/><br/>Take It Easy is often compared to Bingo because of the familiar pattern of a number being called and then everybody looking at their cards to play it, and then scoring if a line is completed. But that's as far as the comparison goes.

Players offer trades by crying out the number of cards they want to swap (&ldquo;One! One! One!&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Three! Three! Three!&rdquo;) but not their identity. The winner of the hand is the first to collect all of one commodity, declaring &ldquo;Corner on Wheat!&rdquo; or whatever commodity has been collected. The winner of the hand scores points equal to the value of the commodity, and the winner of the game is the first to 500 points.<br/><br/>The 1904 Edition of Pit added much fancier artwork and the famous Bull and Bear cards, which provide wild-card and penalty features.

Continue till 0-1 people left with cards in front; they take them back to hand.<br/><br/>Action Step: Start player takes 3 actions, then others take 2 each. Actions can be:<br/>- discard 2 cards, then draw 2<br/>- turn in set of 3-7 cards to send half (rounding down) as many cubes from earth to a planet<br/>- turn in set of 3-7 cards to advance Ship Level, Tech Level, or to make attempt to establish colony on a planet matching cards played: place cubes on that planet into the cosmic ashtray, randomize, then reveal up to as many cubes as attempts made. If reveal your cube, place it on a station; turn over. If other player's cube, send it back to earth.<br/>- Sets: if no wilds (&quot;pure&quot;), take appropriate bonus wild card matching the size of the set (if available); wilds can be used later as parts of sets<br/><br/>Then rotate starting player to the left. Game ends when all stations on 3 planets have been taken. Score VP shown on board (for Tech level, stations occupied, and cubes on earth).

Complete a delivery and make the money you need to buy larger, faster trains, and expand your railroad empire.  Win the game by building the most effective railroad empire!<br/><br/>The original and flagship of Mayfair's crayon-rails line allows players, using washable crayons, to draw their train routes over a map of North America.  Players start with an initial sum of money which they use to build short lengths of track during their first couple of turns.  For the rest of the game, players operate their trains over the track network drawn on the board to pick up and deliver loads to various cities, and then have the opportunity to add to their track network or improve their train.  The game uses demand cards which list three demands, each of a commodity to be delivered to a specified city for a given payoff.  Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income.<br/><br/>Each turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase.  During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player's demand cards.  When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one.  Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards.  When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed.  During the building phase a player may pay to build more track or upgrade his train.<br/><br/>A player wins by being the first to connect his track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.6367, "bayesaverage": 6.49738, "designers": ["Darwin Bromley", "Bill Fawcett"], "categories": ["Economic", "Trains", "Transportation"], "name": {"@sortindex": "1", "#text": "Empire Builder", "@primary": "true"}, "playingtime": 180, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "830"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "510"}], "average": 6.91717, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.44313, "numcomments": 886}, "169": {"mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Point to Point Movement"], "usersrated": 1374, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic620883.jpg", "wishing": 316, "owned": 1788, "trading": 67, "id": 169, "yearpublished": 1993, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 114, "wanting": 117, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic620883_t.jpg", "publishers": ["ABACUSSPIELE", "Eagle-Gryphon Games", "Ferti", "New Games Order, LLC"], "families": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Gryphon Two-Player Games series", "Sports: Combat Sports / Martial Arts"], "description": "Experience the thrill of fencing&mdash; board game style!

Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typicially featuring games and commentary by chess masters.<br/><br/>The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from a similar, much older game of Indian origin. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. The current World Champion is Magnus Carlsen, Norway.

There is a tangle of conflicting popular and scholarly anecdotes attributing its invention to two Chinese emperors, an imperial vassal and court astrologers. One story has it that Go was invented by the legendary Emperor Yao (ruled 2357-2256 BC) as an amusement for his idiot son. A second claims that the Emperor Shun (ruled 2255-2205 BC) created the game in hopes of improving his weak-minded son's mental prowess. A third says the person named Wu, a vassal of the Emperor Jie (ruled 1818-1766 BC), invented Go (as well as games of cards). Finally, a fourth story suggests that Go was developed by court astrologers during the Zhou dynasty (1045-255 BC).<br/><br/>A Go set, consisting of a very general-purpose grid and colored stones, can also be used to play a variety of other abstract strategy games, such as  Connect6, Go-Moku, Pente, and others.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 3.9694, "bayesaverage": 7.42336, "designers": ["(Uncredited)"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy"], "name": "Atari Go", "playingtime": 90, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "97"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "6"}], "average": 7.67696, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.9101, "numcomments": 3079}, "189": {"mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Memory", "Trading"], "usersrated": 823, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic289674.jpg", "wishing": 76, "owned": 1451, "trading": 64, "id": 189, "yearpublished": 1999, "maxplayers": 4, "numweights": 72, "wanting": 25, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic289674_t.jpg", "publishers": ["KOSMOS"], "families": ["Catan", "Cities: N\u00fcrnberg"], "description": "Based on the well-known Settlers of Catan, this stand-alone game published in commemoration of the anniversary of the founding of the city of N&uuml;rnberg gives players some new twists to the familiar experience.

Actions include accusing other politicians of espionage (potentially exiling them to Siberia), pardoning them, reshuffling the politburo and others.

Once a turn each politburo member must face a health roll which can result in sickness marker or even instant death (the older, the most likely).

Individual pieces of a set are worthless at game's end, but are able to be sold during the course of the game in order to provide a cash-flow.<br/><br/>These 'properties' are represented on cards. There are 12 different types of properties, varying from 3 - 6 pieces per set. Naturally, the sets containing six pieces are much more valuable than the sets containing only three pieces as it is much more difficult to complete these larger sets.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt six cards and given a starting 'fund' of $2,000. The top 'property' card is revealed and a bidding ensues. The winner pays the bank and takes the card into his hand. The player then has the option of selling 1 - 3 properties to the bank. The idea here is to rid yourself of properties that you do not wish to collect and provide a source of income.<br/><br/>There is danger, however. The sales price is determined randomly via the roll of two dice. The price can vary from 25% - 100% of the listed worth of the item. Further, if a '0' is rolled on one of the dice, then the item is NOT sold outright, but rather an auction takes place amongst the players. This can result in a substantially reduced price to the seller, or a higher price, depending upon the demand for the item. Further, it is quite possible that no one desires the item, so the seller must take the item back into his hand. There is also the possibility that the player will earn a $200 bonus if the proper digit is rolled on one of the dice.<br/><br/>When a property is sold, it is placed on the appropriate section of the 'board' - 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% (there really isn't a board, just a card holder that indicates these sections). After a player sells properties, he may surrender one of the special 'buyer' cards and purchase from 1 - 3 cards from one of these markets. The player must pay the indicated price (based on the particular percentage market where the property is located) and take the property into his hand.<br/><br/>Again, there is a decision to be made here. Buyer cards are very valuable, as they can be used in a number of fashions:<br/><br/>1) Purchase properties, as described above;<br/><br/>2) Used as a 'wild' card to complete a set; or<br/><br/>3) Valued as $500.00 at the end of the game.<br/><br/>So, a player has to weigh the advantages of each of these options and play accordingly.<br/><br/>Buyer cards are purchases at auction in conjunction with a property card. When a Buyer card is revealed, another card is then revealed, and both cards are then auctioned together. The auction is a 'sealed' auction, however, so the stakes are often high as these cards carry tremendous advantages.<br/><br/>The game continues in this fashion until the property deck expires or a player calls an end to the game. One can only do this, however, if he has a total value (property sets plus cash) in excess of $5,000. Even then, a player should only do this when he feels he has more assets than any of his opponents.<br/><br/>As High Bid, this game was published for the 3M Bookshelf Series and 3M Gamette Series.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 1.8, "bayesaverage": 5.55076, "designers": ["Larry Winters", "P.

In your turn, you can either place a tile in your pub, representing different types of seating (bar, patio, formal) &amp; activities (dancing, shooting pool, playing fooseball), or you can select a customer card, to draw in customers to those specific tiles, if you have the seating available. A third choice is to take a Billing card, which gives you a tip in cash money, and makes all customers in all the players bars pay their bills too. Yellow customers are worth 10 DM, red 20 DM and blue customers pay 30 DM.<br/><br/>When there are at least ten customers floating around, players can also spend a Action card which moves customers around. The cards either move off a specific tile type to a type you choose, or from a tile type you choose to a specific tile. So you might move customers specifically from the terrace seating to any other type of your choice (such as the disco floor), or from a tile of your choice (such as the bar) to specifically a Pool Table. The cards allow from 1-4 customers to move, depending on the tiles.<br/><br/>This is the clever part. As the customers move, they normally pay their bill, unless the Action card shows a No Pay symbol, making them bill-dodgers. When customers move, they first look for a suitable spot within the same pub! Only if they can't find one (either it lacks that type of tile, or there isn't enough room to accommodate them), do they then start wandering clockwise to the next pub, and keep going until they find a suitable spot. If they can't, they leave the game.<br/><br/>So if you have an Action card that pays a bill, and you have the right empty spaces in your bar (because you've carefully put in a variety of attractions), you move your customers around inside your bar and collect the money (&quot;Hey, we're paying our bar tab now, we're gonna shoot some Pool&quot;). If you have a suitable Action card with a No Pay symbol, you move customers from another player's bar into yours (&quot;This place stinks guys, let's skip out and find a Fooseball!&quot;). It is this clever management of customers that will net you big profits.<br/><br/>And if your bar is pretty full, especially with blue and red customers, you call a billing as your first action. The other players also collect, but you should have a margin on them, plus the tip (from 30-70 DM).<br/><br/>There are always three Customer cards and three Action cards face up, and two fresh tiles, so you should be able to make good choices and plan ahead a little. The game ends when the Action cards or the Billing cards are exhausted.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the most money, having milked the punters as much as possible.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 2.0909, "bayesaverage": 5.60057, "designers": ["Stefan Dorra"], "categories": ["Economic"], "name": "Volle Hutte", "playingtime": 30, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "5572"}], "average": 6.16044, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.25507, "numcomments": 53}, "220": {"mechanics": ["Auction/Bidding"], "usersrated": 4289, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1513386.jpg", "wishing": 520, "owned": 4776, "trading": 182, "id": 220, "yearpublished": 1995, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 468, "wanting": 166, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1513386_t.jpg", "publishers": ["AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH", "Eagle-Gryphon Games", "Foxgames (Poland)", "Kanga Games", "Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH", "\u00dcberplay", "University Games", "Wargames Club Publishing"], "families": ["Gryphon Games bookshelf series"], "description": "In Reiner Knizia's High Society, players bid against each other to acquire the various trappings of wealth (positive-number and multiplier cards) while avoiding its pitfalls (negative number and divisor cards).

The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history.  Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game's clever mechanisms can help balance that out.  At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board.<br/><br/>Gameplay:  Each player selects a color and takes all pieces of that color, as there are different miniatures for each of the 7 Epochs, these should be sorted by Epoch.  The game board is a stylized version of the globe.  The Event cards should be separated into Greater and Lesser Events.  Each player is dealt 3 Greater Events. These are either Minor Empires, Leaders, Weaponry or Reallocation.  Each player is also dealt 7 Lesser Events.  There are 22 different types of Lesser Events (Disasters, Diseases, and Special abilities, to name a few).  Players roll 2 dice and determine first player and begin drawing their first Epoch empires.  One unique mechanism is that the drawing player can examine their drawn empire and decide whether to keep it for themselves or give it to another player who hasn't gotten one yet.  If it is given to another player, the receiving player has no choice but to keep it for himself to play that Epoch.  Then the next player draws and makes his decision.  The player who gives their drawn Empire has to wait until given an empire by another player or until the last player draws.  Each Empire card contains the Empire name, how many troops the Empire has for expansion, the Empire's starting land space, if it has a Capitol or not (barbarian or nomadic nations frequently do not) and if it has any Navigation (Seas and Oceans to travel by).  One player reads out the Epochs Empires in order and turns are taken, in this roughly historical order, when a player's Empire is called.<br/><br/>Before the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand.  The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire's actions.  If the player's active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them).  A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop).  If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire's starting land with one unit of the Empire's available troops.<br/><br/>Since each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer.  To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it.  Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender's land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from.  In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well.  If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense.  Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker.  In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the now-empty land space.<br/><br/>At any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort.  On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land.  Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues.  Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered).  After the active player's Empire is finished with it's actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument.<br/><br/>Then scoring takes place.  Each area (Middle-East, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch.  One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land).  Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area). The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area).  These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (Middle-East is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example).  Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player's color from all Empires controlled that remain on board.  Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled. After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn.<br/><br/>After all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a pre-eminence marker and places it in front of him.  These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then.  This bonus to leader helps balance the Empire-draw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later. Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player).<br/><br/>Victory: After the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a pre-eminence marker, all players reveal their pre-eminence markers and add them to their scores.  The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>    <a target='_blank' href=\"http://gamesbyemail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://gamesbyemail.com</a> (English, turn-based)<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": 3, "averageweight": 2.7836, "bayesaverage": 6.79223, "designers": ["Gary Dicken", "Steve Kendall", "Phil Kendall"], "categories": ["Ancient", "Civilization", "Medieval", "Renaissance", "Wargame"], "name": "Empire", "playingtime": 180, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "496"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "123"}], "average": 7.13317, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.48625, "numcomments": 1440}, "225": {"mechanics": [], "usersrated": 598, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2038742.jpg", "wishing": 195, "owned": 1304, "trading": 21, "id": 225, "yearpublished": 1989, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 47, "wanting": 75, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2038742_t.jpg", "publishers": ["IcehouseGames", "Looney Labs"], "families": ["Looney Pyramids", "Tube Games"], "description": "This is the game that introduced Icehouse Pieces.

The Mediterranean was a sea of great prosperity - the only route between East and West. The greatest fleets of the age battled for the most lucrative trade routes.<br/><br/>Trade cities like Venice, Genoa, Barcelona or Istanbul grew as powerful as whole nations, establishing trade routes as far as North Africa or Middle East, bringing back Spice, Gems or Gold to the western Mediterranean. SERENISSIMA recreates this era, when the Mediterranean was at the centre of world trade.<br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>Each players assume the role of one of those four city-states. Their goal is to establish their sphere of influence in the Mediterranean, and share all sorts of commodities to make their trading empire the most prosperous. In the course of a game, players must build galleys, hire crew and buy/sell commodities. The value of goods can be influenced by players having monopolies in certain commodities. Players can also take control of ports, thereby earning extra income from players using the port, as well as being able to get this port's specific commodity.<br/><br/>In the end, the scoring is based on the number of ports each player control, but also on the fact that those ports have commodities of different kind available. Ports come in three types : small, medium, and city-states. Whereas small ports are quite easy to satisfy (they need only two commodities to be considered &quot;full&quot;), the four starting city-states are far more difficult to please, as they will need all kind of commodities available (6 additional commodities, plus the one they produce).<br/><br/>During the course of the game, the number and type of commodities available in ports also controls the number of crew members you can hire, if you can build galleys or forts, and the price of commodities when you sell them. For example, a player won't be able to build new galleys until they have wood and iron available in one of the ports they control. Once a galley has been built, it has 5 spaces available, that can be filled by the crew or the goods. Every crew member allows movement through one space, and makes the galley more powerful. But those spaces are also needed to carry the goods that are worth money. Money that can be used to hire new crews, build new galleys, or commodities. A balance thus needs to be struck between trading commodities and taking control of ports - between a fleet of merchant galleys and a fleet of warships.<br/><br/>The game lasts between 5 to 8 turns depending on the number of active players. Turn order is defined by bidding. The winner of the bid choose whether he will play first, second, third or last. Depending on the situation and what the player wants to do, playing first or last might be equally interesting. For example, by playing first, a player would be unable to react to other players move, but he could avoid having his galleys blockaded.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 3.0558, "bayesaverage": 6.42861, "designers": ["Dominique Ehrhard", "Duccio Vitale"], "categories": ["Economic", "Nautical", "Renaissance"], "name": "M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e", "playingtime": 120, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "926"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "527"}], "average": 6.88631, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.38645, "numcomments": 709}, "234": {"mechanics": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Point to Point Movement", "Simulation"], "usersrated": 4256, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2872065.jpg", "wishing": 2035, "owned": 6626, "trading": 219, "id": 234, "yearpublished": 1996, "maxplayers": 2, "numweights": 540, "wanting": 499, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2872065_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Valley Games, Inc.", "Avalon Hill", "Descartes Editeur", "Hobby World", "PHALANX", "Phalanx Games Deutschland", "Smart Ltd"], "families": ["Ancient Rome", "Continent: Africa", "Valley Games Tactics Line"], "description": "This game uses the very popular card system which first appeared in Avalon Hill's We the People game to detail the struggle between Carthage's Hannibal and the Roman Republic in approximately 200 BC.<br/><br/><br/>(from Valley Games website:)<br/><br/>One of the greatest military commanders and tacticians in history descends on the Roman Empire once again.

A president for life (El Presidente) is elected and then she or he allocates roles for all other players.  Depending upon his or her office and the various cards they hold, each player has a certain number of votes. These are important for the first vote to elect El Presidente and then there are votes each turn on the budget proposed by the President. The budget starts when the President draws 8 money cards face down from the money deck (which varies in denomination from $1 to $3) and proposes allocations. Not everyone will be included in the budget and the amounts are at the President's discretion. The President can keep undisclosed foreign aid money.<br/><br/>Players may attempt to assassinate the other players including the President by guessing where they will be from among five locations. Players who successfully assassinate another player take that player's unbanked money, the only safe money is the money that has been deposited in a players' Swiss bank account, and the only way to get to the bank is to survive the assassination round.<br/><br/>If players are unhappy, see an advantage, or just want to, and there is a 'coup excuse', they can start a coup. A coup sees players compete using armed forces to control a majority of the 5 power centers. Rebel players control the forces of the role which they were assigned prior to the coup  (e.g. army, navy, air force), and players loyal to the President do the same, seeking to control the strongholds until the coup is over.

Game takes about 10 minutes to learn and 1-2 hours to play, high solitaire playability.  The rules are as simple as possible. Units have Zones of control, which cannot be exited. When in enemy ZOC, combat is mandatory. Units may advance after combat. Retreats through ZOCs are forbidden, so you need to surround the enemy to eliminate him. Artillery may fire two hexes away (and not suffer from adverse results). Cavalry units are just faster and weaker infantry units .  There are two scenarios.  The historical one pictures Napoleon in Jena, outnumbering the Prussians, and Davout in Auerstadt, outnumbered by other Prussians. ). To win, you have to eliminate as many enemy units as possible at the end of the game (thus demoralizing the enemy).

Players vie for dominance of early 19th Century Europe. As the French player, you'll set Napoleon and his armies upon a continent whose differing political statures plays right into your hands. The greatest army in Europe is at your hands...<br/><br/>Divide and conquer! As the British player, you'll utilize diplomacy, clever event play, a powerhouse economy and the greatest navy in the world to become the dominant nation. As Russia, Austria, Prussia, Spain or the Ottoman Empire, you must strike a balance between expansionist aggression and diplomatic harmony among your neighbors. Indeed, a nation must expand to triumph. However the means chosen to that end will largely decide the level of success. Play  the part of being everyone's friend and your nation will likely live in relative safety...and lose the game miserably. Play the part of the blind aggressor and you'll likely go down faster than the peace broker. Striking a balance is critical.<br/><br/>The game map covers the territories from Scandinavia in the north to the Mediterranean and North Africa in the south, and from deep Russia in the east to Portugal and the Atlantic in the west. Movement is by areas (provinces) on land, and sea zones at sea. On land, the units of maneuver are (roughly) corps, while at sea each unit represents a naval squadron. When opposing land armies meet for battle, corps are broken down into divisions (loosely) and deployed on a eight zone battle map for combat resolution. The dice-less combat engine uses a system of battle options which are played and cross-referenced for resolution of actual casualties and morale loss. The number of battle options distributed, along with the initial army morale of the opposing sides, is determined by army size, nationality and leaders present. The battle options are of offensive and defensive nature. The offensive options cover standard maneuvers such as &quot;Flank Attack&quot;, &quot;Cavalry Charge&quot; and &quot;Assault&quot;, while the defensive options are things such as &quot;Refuse Flanks&quot;, &quot;Squares Formed&quot; and &quot;Reverse Slopes&quot;.<br/><br/>The rules are relatively simple and fast moving, even though a host of subtleties and complexities of the Napoleonic period are represented within the game system. The means by which this relative simplicity was achieved was (largely) through the use of self-explanatory strategic event charts. Be warned: This game is easy to understand and play, but very difficult to master.<br/><br/>The game system works the same whether you're playing with two players or seven. With multiple players, you'll need all of your diplomacy skills to enlist aid in achieving your goals. With fewer players, the event charts will handle the bulk of the diplomatic duties. Regardless of how many players you have, all seven major powers will actively participate to a greater or lesser degree.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 3.4, "bayesaverage": 5.54657, "designers": ["Nicolas Pilartz", "Kevin Zucker"], "categories": ["Economic", "Napoleonic", "Negotiation", "Wargame"], "name": "The Emperor's War: 1805-1815", "playingtime": 240, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "7902"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "1773"}], "average": 6.38333, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.64156, "numcomments": 37}, "277": {"mechanics": ["Set Collection", "Trading"], "usersrated": 835, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1101876.jpg", "wishing": 91, "owned": 1512, "trading": 149, "id": 277, "yearpublished": 1991, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 80, "wanting": 28, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1101876_t.jpg", "publishers": ["Queen Games", "Avalanche Press Ltd.", "Hexagames (I)"], "families": [], "description": "In Res Publica you are the will of the people, guiding five ancient civilizations to greater heights of power and technology.<br/><br/>Each turn, the active player makes a trade offer... and each player in turn responds in kind.

In addition, the players start the game with two village cards and a road card connecting them. There are card stacks of more roads and villages, as well as cities, to be purchased during the game. With each new village or city comes two new resource cards. Villages and cities give victory points.<br/><br/>When the number die is rolled, instead of collecting more cards, the players rotate the corresponding card 90 degrees to indicate a gain of one more of that resource; i.e., the brick card shows a picture of one brick on one edge of the card, two bricks on the next clockwise edge, three bricks along the third edge, and zero bricks on the fourth edge.

In the box are fourteen games themed on ancient Rome. The games are themed to cover, albeit in a highly abstract fashion, the rise of Rome, the Roman Republic and finally, the Empire.<br/><br/>(7 of the games are described below)<br/><br/>The Wheel of History : 2-5 players<br/><br/>This is an early version of what was to become Bunte Runde. 25 cards are laid out in a large circle, representing the tribes to be united under early Rome. Players may advance a pawn one, two or three spaces forwards and collect a card. Cards are scored on face value, but there are some quirks that vary this.<br/><br/>The Seven Hills of Rome : 2 players<br/><br/>This is one of the easier games in the compendium. The theme here is you are battling your opponent for control of the seven hills of Rome. The hills are represented by seven cards, numbered 1 to 7, laid out between the players. Cards are played from a hand against the 'hills' in an attempt to influence them to your side. You sum the hills you control at the end of the game, and the highest total wins.<br/><br/>Mercator : 3-7 players<br/><br/>This game is Medici's ancestor. It is a simplified version of Medici, with the chief differences being you can hold six cards on your ship, and you are competing for highest value totals only. The number of each suit taken is meaningless, except in a variant where you get paid a bonus if you get one of each. The game lasts only one round. Medici is worth purchasing on its own, but this is still worth a look.<br/><br/>Imperium : 3-5 players<br/><br/>The aim is to earn points for control of each of the 9 areas on the board. The game lasts 9 turns, and at the end of each turn, the area matching the turn number is evaluated for control and points are awarded. On your turn, 3 cards are revealed simultaneously. These cards are numbered 1 to 9, with 2 additional banner cards. The numbers correspond to the areas you want to place control markers into. The banner cards indicate you want one or two extra chips placed in the indicated area. After control markers are placed, the current turn's area is evaluated - points being awarded to the winner and perhaps the second and third places as well. After 9 turns, the player with the most points wins. As you progress, the points awarded for each area increases, giving a nice feeling of acceleration.<br/><br/>Senator : 2-3 players<br/><br/>You play a Roman faction trying to position your people (a hand of cards) into the senate. They can only get their via the senate steps. The board is a grid of 5x5 spaces, The 9 spaces in the center are the senate, while 12 of the remaining 16 are the steps spaces that run around the perimeter of the senate. Cards are placed initially on the steps, and then pushed into the senate by placing more cards on the steps.<br/><br/>Circus Maximus : 3-5 players<br/><br/>A simple chariot racing game where players are competing to be the first to get their team of three chariots around the hex map circuit and onto the podium. Each player has a set of cards face up in front of them, numbered 1 to 5. To move a chariot they select up to three cards per chariot which that is the movement allowance for that piece. The movement off each card must be in a straight line, so some rather clumsy cornering ability is built into the game. Cards used by a chariot are turned face down, becoming unavailable for the other chariots still to move. Each chariot must be moved at least once per turn, if possible. Therefore, the trick is to maximize your movement with your 15 points each turn.<br/><br/>Consul : 2-4 players<br/><br/>This is an intriguing memory game, that, like most of the games in this compendium, have a hard time being fitted into a theme! Twenty-five cards are turned face down in a grid. Players start the game each holding three cards in their hand. On their turn, players make a bid to take a turn. The highest bid gets to turn up cards until they choose to finish, or make a mistake. Cards in a set can be of the same value, or same color, or both. The value of the set must equal of exceed the bid made, simply by summing the face values of the cards. If a mistake is made, the cards are turned face down, and the player must discard a card from their hand into the grid. If the bid is made, the cards are taken into the players hand. At the end of the game, the highest total held wins.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Translated rulebook to the contrary, this game has never been published by an English publisher.<br/><br/>Note: 3 of these have been printed/repackaged in English by GMT in Rome: Imperium, Circus Maximus, Hannibal vs Rome<br/><br/>", "minplayers": 2, "averageweight": 2.1818, "bayesaverage": 5.71042, "designers": ["Reiner Knizia"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Game System"], "name": "Neue Spiele im alten Rom", "playingtime": 0, "ranks": [{"friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "name": "boardgame", "value": "3659"}, {"friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "name": "strategygames", "value": "152"}], "average": 6.80592, "median": 0.0, "stddev": 1.34462, "numcomments": 73}, "281": {"mechanics": ["Commodity Speculation", "Pick-up and Deliver"], "usersrated": 124, "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1851288.jpg", "wishing": 7, "owned": 192, "trading": 15, "id": 281, "yearpublished": 1991, "maxplayers": 5, "numweights": 11, "wanting": 7, "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1851288_t.jpg", "publishers": ["G&RRR"], "families": [], "description": "from the translation:<br/>The Swedish East India Company loaded their ships in G&ouml;teborg with Swedish export goods.

Players compete against one another to achieve the victory criteria for their empires. Nations quickly become rivals, involving them in death struggles over expansion. Each turn (90 years) will see new countries come to the fore, while established empires struggle to levy reinforcements and arrange alliances. A fine line must be walked between conserving one's forces and expanding one's empire. Too much expansion will see your resources spread thin and possibly swept away by a new emerging empire, but not enough aggression will see your empire fail to garner sufficient victory points to win.<br/><br/>Armies are of a mix of foot and mounted units, along with the occasional leader of note. It is not enough to conquer -- you must be able to keep what you have taken. The winner will be the one who has the most victory points after all the armies have had their moment on the stage.

Players lay long tiles to build 5 towers taller and taller, whilst betting on which will be the tallest to shortest.

Since the draw piles are face-up, I might want to draw from pile 3 to get a tile which will boost a tower I've bet on, but that means I have to lay a card three stories, and so I might have to play a tile from my hand that helps the other players!
